<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> writing of Borrow since the
publication of Dr. W. I. Knapp&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life, Writings, and
Correspondence of George Borrow&rdquo; (Murray, 1899) must of
need acknowledge the invaluable services conferred upon the
student by that monumental work.&nbsp; Its store of documents is
the harvest of a lifetime of devoted labour, and it bridges many
a yawning gulf which aforetime left the Borrovian explorer
disconsolate.&nbsp; In this monograph, where Dr. Knapp is
directly quoted, the fact is generally mentioned either in the
text or by way of footnote; but it seemed fitting that there
should be some more definite expression of my indebtedness to his
affectionate diligence in those long and fruitful researches,
which alone have made possible a consecutive story of
Borrow&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>An inquiry into the Cornish origin of the Borrow family, into
the circumstances of Borrow&rsquo;s visit to the home of his
forbears, and of his tour in Cornwall, was responsible for the
inception of the present book.&nbsp; The astonishing contrast
between the Borrow of the common conception and Borrow as he
really was in the flesh and in the spirit gradually forced itself
upon me.&nbsp; Borrow has been popularly regarded in two
lights.&nbsp; Many people have had a vague idea that if <a
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>he was not a
gypsy he was &ldquo;half a gypsy, or something of the
sort.&rdquo;&nbsp; More instructed opinion has accepted his
affection for East Anglia, the country of his birth, and his
glorification of Anglo-Saxonism, as sufficient evidence that he
was himself an Anglo-Saxon.&nbsp; Both views are wrong.&nbsp; He
was of Celtic origin; his genius was Celtic, though its
attributes were modified by many influences.&nbsp; Here is the
explanation of many things in Borrow&rsquo;s life and work which
can be explained in no other way.&nbsp; If the part of the book
referring to his Cornish associations appears to be out of
proportion to the rest, my excuse lies here also.</p>
<p>Further, the Cornish episodes are those least known in
Borrow&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; My object has been, so far as the
narrative is concerned, to strengthen the connecting links
between those portions of his career which he set forth in his
autobiographies, rather than to re-traverse ground where he
himself trailed the pen.</p>
<p>Gratitude must be expressed for much assistance given to me in
the elucidation of obscure points and in the tracing of
documents.&nbsp; First, I am indebted to Mr. Theodore
Watts-Dunton, not only for liberty to draw upon his rich store of
recollections of his friend, but for much advice, assistance, and
suggestion, the value of which it is difficult to
overestimate.&nbsp; No little of the revival of interest in
Borrow and the subjects with which he dealt is due to the vogue
given to &ldquo;gypsyism&rdquo; in literature by the
extraordinary success of that wonderful novel, <a
name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>&ldquo;Aylwin,&rdquo; and the fascinations of its
heroine, Sinfi Lovel, of whom Mr. Watts-Dunton and Borrow
conversed during those walks commemorated in Dr. Gordon
Hake&rsquo;s sonnet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he, Lavengro, towering by
your side,<br />
With rose complexion and bright silvery hair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would stop amid his swift and lounging stride<br />
To tell the legends of the fading race&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As at the summons of his piercing glance,<br />
Its story peopling his brown eyes and face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While you called up that pendant of romance<br />
To Petulengro with his boxing glory,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your Amazonian Sinfi&rsquo;s noble story!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Francis Edwards, of Marylebone, has generously given
permission for the reproduction of exceedingly interesting
passages from unique copies of Borrow&rsquo;s books in his
possession.&nbsp; To the kindness of Mrs. Ford, of Pencarrow, is
due some of the additional information about the relations of
Borrow with her husband, Richard Ford.&nbsp; For East Anglian
memories I have consulted, among others, Mr. William Dutt, of
Lowestoft, and Mr. William Mackay, of Oulton.&nbsp; Family
documents and reminiscences have been contributed by Mr. W. H.
Borrow, of South Hampstead; Mr. E. Pollard, of Penquite; Mr.
William Pollard, of Woolston, and, above all, by Dr. Reginald
Taylor, of Gray&rsquo;s&rsquo; Inn Road (son of the
&ldquo;gallant girl&rdquo; of the &rsquo;fifties in Cornwall), to
whom my thanks are due especially for the material of the
detailed account of Borrow&rsquo;s Cornish tour.</p>
<p>In the biographical sense, the most important <a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>new
matter is the correspondence between Borrow and Sir John Bowring,
supplied by the courtesy of Sir John&rsquo;s sons, Mr. Lewin B.
Bowring, of Torquay, and Mr. F. H. Bowring, of West
Hampstead.&nbsp; This throws a little light on the mysterious
&ldquo;Veiled Period.&rdquo;&nbsp; The quarrel between Borrow and
Bowring will possibly never be explained quite fully; the
correspondence now summarised or printed for the first time shows
that for more than twenty years Bowring was a good friend of
Borrow&mdash;&ldquo;my only friend,&rdquo; as he said in
1842.&nbsp; Judgment on the merits of the dispute, so far as the
evidence can be taken at present, must go against Borrow.</p>
<p>I have entered with some diffidence upon the discussion of
Borrow&rsquo;s &ldquo;gypsyism&rdquo;; any degree of confidence
which may appear is the offspring of the enthusiastic aid
afforded to me by Mr. R. A. Scott-Macfie, the secretary of the
Gypsy Lore Society.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE WIND ON THE HEATH</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">What</span> is your
opinion of death, Mr. Petulengro?&rdquo; . . .
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s night and day, brother, both sweet things;
sun, moon, and stars, brother, all sweet things; there&rsquo;s
likewise a wind on the heath.&nbsp; Life is very sweet, brother;
who would wish to die?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> speakers were two young men,
met casually on breezy Household Heath outside the city of
Norwich; the time towards sunset on a fine evening; the year at
the beginning of the nineteenth century.&nbsp; The tall young
Englishman who questioned and the lithe swart gypsy who answered
were friends of some years&rsquo; standing, but of infrequent
intercourse.&nbsp; The one, with an absorbing curiosity in all
things rare and strange, especially in rare and strange dialects
and languages, the other, with a gypsy&rsquo;s agile,
half-developed intellect and pagan philosophy, had a common bond
in their love of The Wild and their passion for pugilism and
horse-dealing.</p>
<p>The quality of this friendship was peculiar, but not more
remarkable than the manner of its origin.&nbsp; <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Norman Cross,
on the North Road, is a lonely place, remote from the trafficking
of the world, peopled mainly now by ghosts.&nbsp; In the year
1810 it was the home of several thousands of sorrowful men.&nbsp;
There was enacted the sequel of many an incident in the
world-tragedy of the Great Conflict, for on that solitary
cross-road the Government had built sixteen prisons to hold six
thousand Frenchmen, human spoil of war, and fenced them round
with a palisade.&nbsp; Outside were barracks for the militia who
guarded the prisoners and captives, and wooden houses for the
officers who commanded the militia.&nbsp; It was a fantastic
environment for an episode which determined the career and
directed the effort of such genius as was latent in a boy of
seven.</p>
<p>In one of the wooden huts on the roadside dwelt Captain Thomas
Borrow, a Cornishman, adjutant of the West Norfolk Militia.&nbsp;
With him were his wife, formerly Ann Perfrement, the descendant
of Huguenot refugees, and their two sons, John, aged ten, and
George, aged seven.&nbsp; The younger boy, even at that age, was
fond of self-communion, of solitary wandering; shy of normal
relations with his fellows and prone to scrape acquaintance with
the oddest people he could find.&nbsp; He absorbed impressions
readily; he never forgot what he saw or heard.&nbsp; He observed
how the unhappy prisoners earned some scanty comforts by
straw-plaiting; his dark face was often lit up by the light of
the bonfires on which <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>callous authority threw the dainty
work of French fingers, prohibited and condemned because it
interfered with the prosperity of the Bedfordshire straw
industry.&nbsp; He was one of the astonished listeners to the
adventure of the French officer who hid himself in a refuse bin
and was shot out of prison and collected by the scavengers.&nbsp;
He picked up the friendship of a snake-collector, who told him
the tale of the King of the Vipers, and made him a present of a
toothless snake, which thereafter he carried about in his bosom
as a pet.</p>
<p>This companion of his lonely excursions was with him on the
day when he strolled into a green lane where the gypsies had
encamped.&nbsp; With it he turned the tables on the pair of
vagabonds who threatened to assault him and drown him in the toad
pond for prying into their tents; and, for his supposititious
occult power over a poisonous reptile, he was endowed by them
with the title of &ldquo;sapengro,&rdquo; or snake-master.&nbsp;
Who had been, one moment before, a &ldquo;young highwayman&rdquo;
and a &ldquo;Bengui&rsquo;s bantling&rdquo; <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a> became a &ldquo;precious little
gentleman&rdquo; and a &ldquo;gorgeous angel&rdquo; when the
snake &ldquo;stared upon his enemy with its glittering
eyes&rdquo;; and presently was introduced with ceremony to their
son, a lad of thirteen, ruddy and roguish of face, with whom he
swore eternal brotherhood.</p>
<p>The gypsies camped in the green lane at Norman <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Cross were of
the mighty tribe of Smith, and the roguish lad was Ambrose.&nbsp;
It was Ambrose Smith who figured thereafter in the writings of
the little sapengro as Jasper Petulengro.&nbsp; It was he who
uttered the p&aelig;an of the sun, moon and stars, and the wind
on the heath, when George Borrow met him eight or nine years
afterwards near the encampment outside the city of Norwich.</p>
<p>George was then a youth pretending to learn law in the
respectable office of Simpson and Rackham, in Tuck&rsquo;s Court,
but was far more ardently engaged in studying the by-products of
human society and threading the byways of literature.&nbsp; He
had been wandering on the heath until he &ldquo;came to a place
where, beside a thick furze, sat a man, his eyes fixed intently
on the red ball of the setting sun.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
conversation, which may be found in the twenty-fifth chapter of
&ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; is one of the most remarkable and most
poetical dialogues in the English tongue.&nbsp; It strikes with
perfect accuracy the keynote of George Borrow&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;
The whole chapter is a microcosm of Borrow, his philosophy, his
morals, and his tastes.&nbsp; Its exordium is a passionate
statement of his efforts in search of the heart of things, his
pursuit of the elusive answer to the eternal Question.&nbsp; Its
middle includes some reflections on philological research,
mingled in Borrow&rsquo;s incomparable manner with the pathos of
failure and the humour of success.&nbsp; It has its fling at the
metaphysicians.&nbsp; It reports in vivid <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>words the
earnest sermon of a field preacher; it describes with great
wealth of comparison and eloquence the singing of a hymn on that
Norfolk moor by a crowd of commonplace people elevated to a pitch
of intense feeling by religious enthusiasm: a hymn which echoed
in the ears of the listener many times in after years when in the
great cathedrals of the world he was disappointed with religion
decked out in all the panoply of pomp and circumstance; its
peroration is Mr. Petulengro&rsquo;s immortal pronouncement on
the problem of mortality&mdash;and its epilogue is the
gypsy&rsquo;s invitation to his brother to &ldquo;put on the
gloves, and I will try to make you feel what a sweet thing it is
to be alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the very essence of Borrow&mdash;languages, religion,
hedge-philosophy, and pugilism.&nbsp; The only element missing
from the mixture is one of his characteristic outbursts in praise
of the brown ale of old England.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
likewise a wind on the heath&rdquo; lets us some way into the
heart of Borrow&rsquo;s secret.</p>
<p>The little sapengro of Norman Cross, the inquisitive youth who
discussed Death with Jasper Petulengro, and was boxed out of the
mood of morbid introspection, in which he declared, &ldquo;I
would wish to die,&rdquo; into a healthy appreciation of the
sweetness of Life, played many parts in his long career.&nbsp; He
became scoffing sceptic, Bible missionary and Papist-hater,
traveller, and recluse, philologist and poet.&nbsp; But his
principal service to his day and generation <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>and to their
posterity had nothing to do with philosophy or religion, with
belabouring &ldquo;Romanisers&rdquo; or with evangelical
propagandism, with topography or with languages, or with poetry
in the academic sense.&nbsp; It had everything to do with his
wanderings in green lanes, his &ldquo;love of Nature
unconfined,&rdquo; his acquaintance with the gypsies, his passion
for The Wild, and his devotion to the ruder athletics.&nbsp; Many
an artist imagines that he would make a reputation as a man of
business; many a wizard of accounts has secret dreams of literary
fame.&nbsp; Borrow had an impotent desire for scholarship and the
celebrity of learning; but he laboured better than he knew.&nbsp;
His invaluable bequest is to be disinterred from the numerous
pages of five books, dug out from a mass of irrelevance and
banality; and its inspiration will be found in the words of Mr.
Petulengro: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s likewise a wind on the
heath.&nbsp; Life is very sweet, brother; who would wish to
die?&rdquo; <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a></p>
<p>The man who, preaching from this text, imposed worship on the
English-speaking world, was intensely alive, intensely
egoistic.&nbsp; Often &ldquo;engrossed with the sufferings of
himself and of his soul,&rdquo; as one has written of his hero
Byron, he yet had a keen outlook upon that part of society in
which he could move freely, and, as he saw intensely, was able to
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>produce
intense impressions of his visions upon his readers.&nbsp; He was
a strange, romantic, wayward, irresponsible
man&mdash;irresponsible, that is, to any but his own code of
honour, manliness and virtue.</p>
<p>He was a very Don Quixote of letters.&nbsp; He went about the
world tilting at every windmill he encountered; not infrequently
he would construct windmills on which to break his lance.&nbsp;
If he was often unhorsed and maimed, that did not matter; it
merely made his next onslaught more severe.&nbsp; In one of his
contests with persons who had offended him he speaks of them as
malignant pseudo-critics, by whom he would not allow himself to
be poisoned.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no! he will rather hold them up by
their tails, and show the creatures wriggling, blood and foam
streaming from their broken jaws.&rdquo;&nbsp; Possibly only a
man who had been worsted in his battle could have been guilty of
this.&nbsp; But&mdash;<i>furor arma ministrat</i>; this was
Borrow on the war-path against his critics.&nbsp; The true
Borrovian likes to think of Borrow at another period and in
different circumstances.&nbsp; It was a crabbed literary person
who mangled and was mangled in this fashion.&nbsp; The lover of
his genius pictures him otherwise&mdash;the young and handsome
and vigorous Lavengro, stalking over the high roads and the
byways of England, disputing with scholar or with gypsy, camping
in lonely dingles, conjugating Armenian verbs with Isopel
Berners.&nbsp; He has six feet three inches of height.&nbsp; <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>His hair is
white, but he has the complexion of healthy youth, and eyes dark
and deep as mountain tarns.&nbsp; He revels in the friendship of
gypsies and all the vagrants of earth, and cares for few other
friends.&nbsp; He would rather sing ballads in the tent of a
Romany chal than be entertained in the palace of a prince; he
prefers the society of a prize-fighter to the converse of any
duke.&nbsp; Recall his picture of himself:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A lad who twenty tongues can talk,<br />
And sixty miles a day can walk;<br />
Drink at a draught a pint of rum,<br />
And then be neither sick nor dumb;<br />
Can tune a song and make a verse,<br />
And deeds of northern kings rehearse;<br />
Who never will forsake a friend<br />
While he his bony fist can bend;<br />
And, though averse to brawl and strife,<br />
Will fight a Dutchman with a knife;<br />
Oh, that is just the lad for me,<br />
And such is honest six-foot-three.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, again, in his riper age, as he is described by Mr. Egmont
Hake (Dr. Gordon Hake&rsquo;s fourth son)&mdash;a huge figure of
a fine old man, eccentric of humour, rich beyond measure in the
experience from which he drew anecdote, full of quaint whimsy and
natural conceit.&nbsp; He was, says Mr. Hake
(<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, August 13th, 1881), &ldquo;a choice
companion on a walk, whether across country or in the slums of
Houndsditch.&nbsp; His enthusiasm for nature was peculiar; he
could draw more poetry from a widespreading marsh with its
straggling rushes than from the most beautiful <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>scenery, and
would stand and look at it with rapture.&rdquo;&nbsp; He rejoiced
in a hedge-alehouse, or a coaching inn; he was moved to
passionate delight by local reminiscences of highway robbers,
vagrom scoundrels, pugilists, and vagabonds of all degrees; good
beer was a poem to him.&nbsp; Under all these impressions he
expanded nobly; contact with conventional respectability
shrivelled him up; his <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i> was
&ldquo;gentility.&rdquo;&nbsp; His strength and vigour remained
unimpaired almost to the end of his life; at seventy he would
break the ice on a pond and plunge in to bathe.</p>
<p>No man less fit than this for literary controversy was ever
born into the world.&nbsp; It was an evil fate that launched him
upon those sordid disputations disfiguring the Appendices to
&ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; from which the &ldquo;blood and
foam&rdquo; passage I have quoted is drawn.</p>
<p>Few men bringing to the literary mart so slight a cargo as
Borrow brought have obtained so great a price for it.&nbsp; Some
of his work, judged by any conventional standard, is remarkably
poor.&nbsp; The best of it, judged by the only proper standard
(which is entirely unconventional) is so good that immortality
might be predicted for it by a person inclined to take the risk
of being confuted in some remotely future incarnation.&nbsp; A
great number of the enterprises in which Borrow dissipated many
years of his life may be dismissed as of no literary importance
and of no <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>possible value to any other son of man.&nbsp; His
philology, <i>qu&acirc;</i> philology, is grossly unscientific;
its uses are, in fact, not scientific but artistic.&nbsp; They
reside in the quaint hues it helped him to mix on his palette,
the whimsical, half-serious, half-humorous disquisitions into
which an unusual word would lead him, the ease with which it
enabled him to glorify his picture with the tints of foreign
skies and the forms of strange men.&nbsp; If we are to assess his
linguistic achievements by their practical and immediate results,
the years Borrow spent upon them were squandered.&nbsp; The seeds
of his philological learning,</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Like
Hebrew roots, were found<br />
To flourish most in barren ground.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They produced a meagre crop of translations, of no consequence
either as exercises or as poetry.&nbsp; But that would be a
perverse view to take of Borrow&rsquo;s studies.&nbsp; Their
virtue was not in their verbal fruits, but in the quality they
added to his later work.&nbsp; For example, those &ldquo;deeds of
northern kings rehearsed&rdquo; were rehearsed a great deal
better by other people, and the works of Elis Wyn had been more
efficiently dealt with by a Welshman.&nbsp; But would the shining
history of Isopel Berners have been as glorious if Lavengro had
not been the sort of man to compare her with Ingeborg, the
northern queen who engaged and defeated in single combat each of
her long string of redoubtable brothers?&nbsp; Or would not the
fascinating <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>converse of Lavengro with the Methodist preacher, Peter
Williams, have lost half its charm if the young man had not been
able to talk familiarly with him of Master Elis Wyn and the Bardd
Cwsg?&nbsp; It is the reflected colour of all this word-learning
that gives it a high place in Borrow&rsquo;s development.</p>
<p>He began to study languages almost before he was out of
frocks.&nbsp; He did not find his <i>m&eacute;tier</i> till he
was thirty-eight: &ldquo;The Zincali; or, The Gypsies of
Spain&rdquo; was published in 1841.&nbsp; This was late for a man
who had been so deeply devoted to the pen.&nbsp; His processes
were slow, too.&nbsp; His other books of any significance
numbered only four, and they occupied twenty-one years in
gestation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; was dated 1842,
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; appeared in 1850, &ldquo;The Romany
Rye&rdquo; in 1857, and &ldquo;Wild Wales&rdquo; in 1862.&nbsp;
Much was concentrated in these few works, laboriously elaborated
as they were, and produced with horrible pangs of travail.&nbsp;
They crystallised&mdash;if such a term may be used of
Borrow&mdash;the experiences of a long life of wandering through
the world, and they recorded the opinions collected or developed
by a self-centred man of violent prejudices.&nbsp; They provide
an almost unparalleled conglomeration of good and bad, of false
and sound.&nbsp; They commit inexcusable crimes against every
canon of taste&mdash;and they have in them the true stuff of
poetry and romance.&nbsp; The glamour of these last is over them
all.&nbsp; The poetry of Borrow, one of the <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>most natural
poets who have written in English, takes its spring in the keen
observation and appreciation of the elemental joys found in
Nature&rsquo;s least-trodden ways, and the elemental humours of
her least sophisticated children.&nbsp; It recalls Sidney&rsquo;s
epigram of the excellent poets that never versified and the
versifiers that need never answer to the name of poets.&nbsp; For
Borrow&rsquo;s verse, on the whole, is villainous, and much of
his prose is truest poetry.&nbsp; He restored to us, at any rate
for a time, the picaresque element in romantic literature, and
revived our indulgent fondness for the good-humoured villains of
low life.</p>
<p>With the jovial virtues of Le Sage, however, Borrow combined
in a remarkable way some of the quaintest characteristics of
Sterne.&nbsp; The mark of &ldquo;Shandyism&rdquo; is strong upon
portions of his work&mdash;but let it be said at once that the
philo-pugilist Borrow is absolutely free from any taint of the
pornographic <i>double entendre</i> of the Rev. Laurence Sterne,
M.A.&nbsp; Captain Tom Borrow often rivals My Uncle Toby, and the
battle with Ben Bryan in Hyde Park may be compared as a staple
reminiscence with the Siege of Namur; but there is no Widow
Wadman in &ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ab Gwilym becomes in some
points as delightful as Slawkenbergius, and there are episodes in
&ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; which
may compare with the stories of the Dead Ass and of Lefevre, the
Monk and Maria; but it can be said of Borrow&rsquo;s books with
more truth than a sententious <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>critic once said it of
Sterne&rsquo;s, that they may be submitted to the taste, feeling,
good sense, and candour of the public &ldquo;without the least
apprehension that the perusal of any part of them will be
followed by consequences unfavourable to the interests of
society.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be a negative virtue that a book
fails &ldquo;to bring the blush of shame to the cheek of
innocence&rdquo;; but, for what it is worth, any book of
Borrow&rsquo;s has that merit.</p>
<p>Interesting as these comparisons may be to his admirers,
Borrow must not be judged by any purely literary standards.&nbsp;
One discerning critic, Mr. Thomas Seccombe, has observed that he
&ldquo;wrote with infinite difficulty.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is
evident in almost every page.&nbsp; He had no fatal facility in
composition.&nbsp; He developed no graces of style.&nbsp; The man
who loves Stevenson is probably a man who will also love Borrow,
but for reasons quite apart from style.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s
awkward forms and ugly lapses were calculated to make
Stevenson&rsquo;s delicately tuned literary organism shudder in
its marrow.&nbsp; Their likeness lies in their love of
Out-of-Doors, their capacity for discovering and enjoying the
unusual adventure in the commonplace environment.</p>
<p>I doubt whether Borrow definitely and consciously copied his
style from anybody, or modelled it on any man&rsquo;s writings;
but if we are to go anywhere for his master we must go to Defoe,
whose &ldquo;wondrous volume&rdquo; was his &ldquo;only study and
principal source <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>of amusement&rdquo; in his very small boyhood at East
Dereham.&nbsp; How he apostrophises the wizard!&nbsp; &ldquo;Hail
to thee, spirit of Defoe!&nbsp; What does not my own poor self
owe to thee?&nbsp; England has better bards than either Greece or
Rome, yet I could spare them easier far than Defoe,
&lsquo;unabashed Defoe,&rsquo; as the hunchbacked rhymer styled
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; England may not owe to Defoe all that Borrow
declares she does of her &ldquo;astonishing discoveries both by
sea and land,&rdquo; and her &ldquo;naval glory,&rdquo; but she
certainly owes to him some of the gift that Borrow bestowed upon
her.&nbsp; George had many other points of resemblance to the
&ldquo;illiterate fellow&rdquo; of Swift&rsquo;s satire besides
this&mdash;that they were both at divers times accused of being
illiterate fellows, and both answered back with compound interest
of invective.&nbsp; Both were not only writing men, but also men
of action.&nbsp; Both prided themselves something unduly upon
their philological attainments.&nbsp; Both did late in life the
literary work that won them lasting fame.&nbsp; Above all, they
shared what Defoe wittily described as his &ldquo;natural
infirmity of homely, plain writing.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is, they
had command of a tense, nervous, vigorous English without ornate
excrescences or fanciful refinements of any kind&mdash;the style
which is greatest because it is no style at all, the style which
bites into the mind and irritates the imagination.&nbsp; Both
were able to give verisimilitude to the most fantastical
narratives; both were masters of the form of autobiographical
fiction.&nbsp; <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>The parallel may finish with the remark that neither of
them was a bookish man.</p>
<p>Borrow was not even a great reader.&nbsp; He spent many hours
among books&mdash;but such books!&nbsp; They were mainly
collections of ballads picked from a variety of languages fit
&ldquo;to add a storey to the Tower of Babel,&rdquo; the detritus
of the libraries he visited.&nbsp; He was fond of an uncommon
book, whatever its intrinsic merit, but he was fonder of an
uncommon human being.&nbsp; Men were his books.&nbsp; A ghostly
procession of the authors with whom Borrow had
hobnobbed&mdash;leaving out of account his investigations in
shady paths on behalf of the Newgate Calendar&mdash;would afford
a motley spectacle of tatterdemalions, the rag, tag, and bobtail
of literature.&nbsp; He had inflated ambitions of scholarship,
but, in fact, he had received only an ill-regulated education,
and his taste refused all conventional rules as inventions of the
Devil.</p>
<p>The Bible, Shakespeare in a lesser degree, and Defoe most of
all&mdash;these were his classics.&nbsp; No bad assortment,
either; but the restriction of one&rsquo;s reading to these three
would hardly testify to a catholic taste.&nbsp; His favourite
poet was Byron.&nbsp; The two are as unlike in most particulars
of their dispositions and careers as two heirs of mortality can
be; but it is not difficult to realise that Byron&rsquo;s life
and poetry would touch deep springs in the nature of
Borrow.&nbsp; Like Byron, he worked all his affections, all his
passions, all his prejudices into the very texture of his books,
and in <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>them ran through all the gamut of his most violent
emotions.&nbsp; Like Byron, he had a fond weakness for
melancholy&mdash;what Goethe called &ldquo;the hypochondriac
humour.&rdquo;&nbsp; As in the case of Byron, his melancholy
alternated with spasms of furious elemental rage, expressed in
the unbridled vituperation of his fellow men.&nbsp; So that,
though no two characters more widely different figure in literary
history, there were points of contact and bases of agreement
between them.&nbsp; It was, indeed, a soul attuned to Borrow who
wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis sweet to win, no matter how,
one&rsquo;s laurels,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By blood or ink; &rsquo;tis sweet to put an end<br
/>
To strife: &rsquo;tis sometimes sweet to have our quarrels<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Particularly with a tiresome friend:<br />
Sweet is old wine in bottles, ale in barrels;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear is the helpless creature we defend<br />
Against the world: and dear the schoolboy spot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We ne&rsquo;er forget, though there we are
forgot.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lines may be said to depict Borrow in some of his
best-known aspects&mdash;winning laurels by blood and ink,
quarrelling with tiresome friends, rejoicing in the good things
of life, defending his dependents, and treasuring the memories of
his childhood.</p>
<p>He threw himself into his works in such a fashion that it is
impossible to elucidate them without reference to his personal
career, or to understand his proceedings without reference to his
books.&nbsp; They are all more or less in the autobiographical
form, and they are all more or less real autobiographies: how
much <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>more
and how much less it is often difficult to say.&nbsp; The secret
of the books, the reason for the fascination they exert upon
mankind, must be found in the man; his own secret must be sought
in two directions.&nbsp; One has already been indicated&mdash;his
love of The Wild.&nbsp; From his gypsies and wanderers, his
hedge-tinkers and vagroms, all the denizens of the heath and the
green lanes&mdash;the society which began to vanish with the
enclosure of the English fields, and is fast disappearing from
the land,&mdash;material unpromising and uncongenial enough to
the general, Borrow contrived to extract fine poetry and mildly
thrilling romance.</p>
<p>And how was it that a man whose pet weakness was his idolatry
of the Anglo-Saxons, who joyed in thinking himself representative
of what was best and manliest in a race whose aversion from the
Romany is so pronounced, was the man of all others in England who
seemed to get into closest touch with the gypsies, to understand
them and to be understood of them?&nbsp; Perhaps a little because
of his philological craze and the avidity with which he set
himself to pick up their language.&nbsp; But the real explanation
is that, in fact, Borrow was no Anglo-Saxon at all.&nbsp; His
vainglorious boasts of Anglo-Saxon breeding were based on nothing
more substantial than the fact that his father and mother
happened to be living in Norfolk at the time when he came into
the world.&nbsp; He was a Celt of Celts.&nbsp; His genius was
truly Celtic.&nbsp; His father was a Cornishman whose family <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>had resided
in the West-country peninsula&mdash;Lord Courtney&rsquo;s
&ldquo;emerald, set in a sapphire sea&rdquo;&mdash;for many
generations, and was a Cornish and therefore a Celtic family to
the very tips of its numerous fingers.&nbsp; His mother was of
French descent.&nbsp; Here was a pretty parentage for a bluff and
hearty champion of optimistic and progressive Anglo-Saxondom!</p>
<p>Borrow was fond of Norfolk: the rest was affectation.&nbsp; He
had all the Celtic characteristics&mdash;the quick and lively
imagination, the poetic temperament, the intensely emotional
nature, the tendency to melancholy.&nbsp; The only writer who,
within my knowledge, has laid effective stress on this is Mr.
Watts-Dunton.&nbsp; Borrow loved the wide level landscapes, the
marshes and broads of East Anglia, just as FitzGerald did, a
descendant of Irishmen who was born in the East.&nbsp; Various
reasons conspired to produce this affection.&nbsp; Norfolk was
the scene of his boyish exploits.&nbsp; In Norfolk lived the
mother he worshipped.&nbsp; There he met the wife who was his
truest friend and finest comrade.&nbsp; But the spirit of East
Anglia, the Teutonic tradition, did not preside over
Borrow&rsquo;s destiny and direct his moral and intellectual
fortunes.&nbsp; It was the spirit of Old Cornwall, its remote
hills peeping out of vales of mystery towards an empyrean where
every cloud breathed legend, the land of weird imaginings, of
saintly lore, and chivalric romance.&nbsp; The bluff and blunt
and downright John-Bullery that Borrow affected was but a pose;
the heat of the fires of the <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Underworld creeps up into his work,
and the pale light of the Overworld shines down upon it.&nbsp; He
is constantly on the brink of moral tragedy and ever listening to
the rumble of the spiritual upheaval.&nbsp; What stirs him most
to eloquence and deep feeling is Celtic Ireland or Celtic Wales,
the wild music of the speech of Murtagh the Papist gossoon, the
&ldquo;noble mountains, green fields, and majestic woods&rdquo;
of the Cymric land.</p>
<p>Many peculiarities of Borrow, on a superficial examination,
seem to offer flat contradiction to this view.&nbsp; His
&ldquo;Poperyphobia&rdquo; appears to be difficult to reconcile
with his unquestionable sympathy with the Celtic spirit of
Ireland.&nbsp; He affects the Orange hue; whenever he sees a
Catholic head he hits it.&nbsp; We need not seek far for the
explanation.&nbsp; His mother was of a Huguenot family which had
been driven out of France by the persecutions of the Catholic
Church: Borrow idolised his mother.&nbsp; Further, it never
mattered to him whether an injury was two days or two centuries
old; he hated the offender just the same.&nbsp; His father had
quarrelled, long before George was born, with a gentleman named
Hambly.&nbsp; To the end of his life Borrow swore that a person
named Hambly could never be good.&nbsp; His adulation of violent
sports and his pathetic belief in the immaculate supremacy of the
English in all athletics are other facts which on the surface may
seem to upset the theory of an obsessing Celtic mysticism.&nbsp;
But even <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>here his ancestry counts for much.&nbsp; The Cornish
were ever devoted to athletic contests; their cousins the Welsh
are in one of the realms of sport unparalleled and
unapproachable.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s good-ale-of-old-England
fetish surprised the decent and sober people of Wales, and his
&ldquo;wishy-washy tea&rdquo; is the national beverage of
Cornwall.&nbsp; But his devotion to malt liquor was a part of his
protest against &ldquo;gentility-nonsense&rdquo; and
&ldquo;temperance-canting,&rdquo; about which he raved with even
more than usual violence and incoherence.&nbsp; In the
mid-Victorian age in which he wrote, the glorification of
beer-swilling was as un-&ldquo;genteel&rdquo; as even Borrow
could have desired.</p>
<p>All these idiosyncrasies, however, count for little beside the
deeper characteristics of Borrow&rsquo;s life and work, over
which the Celtic genius reigned.&nbsp; Racial traits were
strongly marked in him, and he is a standing refutation of Mr.
George Moore&rsquo;s dictum that &ldquo;the land makes the
Celt,&rdquo; and that it is not a question of race.&nbsp; In this
heredity we must look for the beginnings of any proper view of
Borrow.</p>

21</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A WANDERING YOUTH</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Borrows of Tredinnick, in the
parish of St. Cleer, were proud Cornish yeomen.&nbsp; For
centuries they had occupied the same house and farmed the same
land.&nbsp; Now they have been scattered over the world, in true
Cornish fashion, and there is not a Borrow left in the
district.</p>
<p>Tredinnick is a little old house in a hollow, about a mile
north-west of St. Cleer Church, near Liskeard, among the hills of
Eastern Cornwall.&nbsp; It is a long, low, stone-fronted building
of two storeys, backed by a row of tall elms standing at the
roadside, with an apple orchard behind, and the ground at the
side sloping away into a deep valley of orchards and
meadows.&nbsp; The place is quite unpretentious; the farm is
little more than fifty acres in extent, and the house has lost in
the lapse of time the neatness that would have shown in the abode
of Borrow&rsquo;s <i>gentill&acirc;tre</i>.&nbsp; Still, for a
farmhouse, it is commodious.&nbsp; It has walls two feet thick,
and in the long, raftered, slate-floored kitchen are deep
window-seats, and an open hearth and chimney-corner, the
crock-hook depending in the midst.&nbsp; Lavengro would have <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>rejoiced in
such a place.&nbsp; The dining-room and sitting-room are on the
other side of the entrance, and communicate&mdash;respectable but
undistinguished rooms.</p>
<p>In this home was born, in December, 1758, Thomas, father of
George Borrow.&nbsp; He was a posthumous child.&nbsp; We have a
very fair picture of him in the opening chapters of
&ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; We see him in youth, the favourite
of his mother, whose special care of him was the cause of
jealousy in his six brothers.&nbsp; We learn that shortly after
he was eighteen his mother died, and he adopted &ldquo;the
profession of arms, which he followed during the remainder of his
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Lavengro, candidly stating that he knows
little about the early life of his father, does not tell us the
circumstances in which he left the homestead at Tredinnick, after
bringing to a disastrous end his apprenticeship to one Edward
Hambly, a maltster.&nbsp; He is described as &ldquo;cool and
collected, slow to anger, though perfectly fearless, patient of
control, of great strength, and, to crown all, a proper man with
his hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; This may in some measure account for the
adulation of prize-fighting which in &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; as
Mr. Birrell has pointed out, scandalised &ldquo;the religious
world&rdquo; that had welcomed with such effusive joy &ldquo;The
Bible in Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; George Borrow inherited a love of
adventure and a fondness for &ldquo;the noble art,&rdquo; and
probably also the aversion from &ldquo;gentility&rdquo; apparent
in the <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>lines with which his autobiography opens.&nbsp; Yet it
is strange that he was really proud of his gentle descent, proud
of his Cornish father and his little-landed ancestry, and proud
of the French extraction of his mother and the small and delicate
hands he got from her.</p>
<p>The manner of departure of Lavengro&rsquo;s father out of
Cornwall had an intimate connection with that properness of his
with his hands.&nbsp; He was at Menheniot Fair with a party of
youths from Liskeard, three or four miles distant, when a row
arose between young Menheniot and young Liskeard; probably some
breeze of incident blew upon the embers of a village feud.&nbsp;
Slow as he was to anger and patient of control, Borrow
nevertheless entered with zest into the fray, for he headed the
Liskeard party and brought the struggle to a climax by knocking
down the constable.&nbsp; Thereafter, fearing the consequences of
his adventure, he departed from the ancestral roof-tree, and
began the wandering life which he was leading when he met the
mother of Lavengro.&nbsp; And small wonder at his flight, for the
constable he knocked down was none other than his own master, the
head-borough, Edward Hambly.&nbsp; The date of the scrimmage was
July 28th, 1783.&nbsp; He disappeared for five months.&nbsp; In
December he turned up at Bodmin and enlisted in the Coldstream
Guards, who had a recruiting party there under Captain William
Morshead, later the celebrated general.&nbsp; The captain, <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>knowing his
antecedents, did all he could to prevent the enlistment, but
without success.</p>
<p>Thomas Borrow may well have recalled the constable of
Menheniot in later years when he did battle in Hyde Park with
&ldquo;big Ben Brain&rdquo; (read Bryan), giving that celebrity a
little useful practice for the contest in which he became
&ldquo;champion of England, having conquered the heroic
Johnson,&rdquo; and paving the way for the friendship to which
all such encounters should lead.&nbsp; Bryan, wrote George in
after years, &ldquo;expired in the arms of my father, who read
the Bible to him in his later moments.&rdquo;&nbsp; What marvel
that &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; is a medley of religion and
beer-drinking, prize-fighting and philosophy?</p>
<p>Thomas vanished for several years into the privacy of a
private of the Coldstreams.&nbsp; Such a man, however, was not
likely to remain permanently in the obscurity of the ranks.&nbsp;
He climbed steadily.&nbsp; After eight or nine years, spent
mostly with the regiment in London, he emerged into view again as
a sergeant, and in 1792 was transferred to the West Norfolk
Militia, whose headquarters were at East Dereham.&nbsp; This was
the origin of all we hear later about the pretty little town of
&ldquo;D&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Dumpling Green, near by, resided Miss Ann Perfrement, sweet
and twenty when Sergeant Borrow marched into her
perspective.&nbsp; She was the daughter of a farmer who had
descended from a Huguenot family, immigrants to Norfolk among
many others&mdash;<a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>including the Martineaus&mdash;after the revocation of
the Edict of Nantes.&nbsp; Miss Perfrement was occasionally
engaged to act minor parts in plays performed at Dereham by
companies sent to the country towns from the Theatre Royal in
Norwich.&nbsp; Her stage presence fascinated the Sergeant, who
had reached the age of thirty-eight proof against all feminine
blandishments.&nbsp; He pursued his courtship of the amateur
actress with ardour and success.&nbsp; She accepted him, and a
most happy union began with their wedding on February 11th,
1793.</p>
<p>The movements of a regiment, even of militia, in those
stirring days were apt to be incalculable.&nbsp; The West
Norfolks threaded the United Kingdom from end to end, combining
the swiftness of a bishop with the unexpected evolutions of a
knight upon the chessboard.&nbsp; Sergeant Borrow got his
commission as captain and adjutant in 1798; in 1800, either at
Chelmsford or Colchester, was born his elder son, John, who
became first a military officer and then an artist, and was one
of Haydon&rsquo;s pupils.&nbsp; In 1803 he was back in Norfolk,
recruiting.&nbsp; At East Dereham, on July 5th in that year,
George Borrow opened his eyes upon a world of which he was to see
so much more than falls to the lot of most sons, even of
soldiers.</p>
<p>This bundle of potentialities was named George in honour of
the King his father served, and Henry after a Cornish
uncle.&nbsp; The first few years of his <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>life were
spent, like those of the young Sternes, at the tail of the
regiment, marching and countermarching in Essex, Kent, and
Sussex, wandering from barracks to barracks as the exigencies of
the army dictated in that day of Napoleonic scares.&nbsp; At the
age of six he returned to &ldquo;pretty D&mdash;,&rdquo; and
there received some of the vivid impressions he has reproduced in
indelible colours upon the earlier pages of
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;&mdash;the dignified rector and Philo, the
clerk, reading &ldquo;their respective portions of the venerable
liturgy,&rdquo; and rolling &ldquo;many a portentous word
descriptive of the wondrous works of the Most High&rdquo;; and
the &ldquo;Lady Bountiful, leaning on her gold-headed
cane.&rdquo;&nbsp; There he revelled in the boy&rsquo;s first
flush of delight over &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe,&rdquo; and imbibed
the germs of that worship of Defoe which shines in all his
work.</p>
<p>The next peregrination of the family was to Norman Cross,
where George met the snake-catcher and received from him the
present of the fangless viper with which he contrived so
effectually to subdue the wrath of old Gypsy Smith and his
evil-looking mort, who &ldquo;wore no cap, and her long hair fell
on either side of her head like horse-tails half way down her
waist; her skin was dark and swarthy, like that of a
toad.&rdquo;&nbsp; We know how he was named
&ldquo;Sapengro,&rdquo; and how brotherhood was sworn between him
and the gypsies&rsquo; son Ambrose, who figures immortally as
Jasper Petulengro.</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>The
sojourn at Norman Cross lasted fifteen months.&nbsp; Then, in
July, 1811, the regiment returned to East Dereham, where George
took his introduction to the science of languages.&nbsp; The
embryo &ldquo;polyglot gentleman&rdquo; laid a sound foundation
upon Lilly&rsquo;s Latin Grammar.&nbsp; However, their wanderings
were by no means at an end.&nbsp; For years there was to be
little rest and small possibility of regular schooling.&nbsp; In
1812 the West Norfolks were moving again&mdash;marching through
the Midlands and the North by slow stages towards Edinburgh,
stopping a month or two here and there.&nbsp; For example, at
Huddersfield they billeted long enough for George to be sent to
the local school.&nbsp; The conditions of such a life were hardly
favourable to the development of scholarship upon conventional
lines.&nbsp; How valuable they were to the cultivation of the
kind of genius that lay behind the forehead of George Borrow it
is difficult to overestimate.&nbsp; He assimilated rich and
varied experience through every pore.&nbsp; He acquired the love
of a roving life, the passionate devotion to the road, that never
left him till the end of his days.&nbsp; His father was a
wanderer before he was born; he was a wanderer himself throughout
his boyhood.&nbsp; It was fit training for the man who was
afterwards to be dubbed &ldquo;the Wandering Jew of
Literature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In April of 1813 the West Norfolks descended upon Edinburgh,
Captain Thomas on horseback leading the van, and Mrs. Borrow and
her boys <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>bringing up the rear in a
&ldquo;po&rsquo;-shay.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were many gay days of
military merry-making at Edinburgh Castle before, in the autumn,
John and George were entered at the High School.&nbsp; Probably
they spent only one session at the academy of classical learning
which had, a generation earlier, turned out so great a genius as
Sir Walter Scott.</p>
<p>There is not much in Borrow&rsquo;s record of the time to
illustrate that session, or to show what point in his youthful
struggle with the dead languages the incipient philologist
reached.&nbsp; Here, as ever, his interests were in the by-paths
of life and learning.&nbsp; David Haggart was more to him than
the ministrations of his painstaking master, Mr. Carson.&nbsp;
Borrow had a catholic and withal a discriminating taste in
vagabonds.&nbsp; It manifested itself even at this early
age.&nbsp; Just as in later years he was fascinated by the
personality of John Thurtell, so was he charmed at Edinburgh by
that weird brigand Haggart, who enlisted in the West Norfolks as
a drummer-boy, having been unearthed at Leith Races by one of
Captain Borrow&rsquo;s recruiting sergeants.&nbsp; The
drummer-boy whom George made his companion subsequently became
burglar, highway robber, murderer, and prison-breaker, and only
suspended his nefarious activities at the end of the
hangman&rsquo;s rope in the year 1821.</p>
<p>The regiment left Edinburgh for home in 1814, on the cessation
of the war.&nbsp; The mustering-out took <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>place at
Norwich, where feastings and congratulations were the order of
many days.&nbsp; George&rsquo;s parents lodged at the Crown and
Angel Inn, while he was sent to the Grammar School.&nbsp; This
time there was some hope that he might be able to continue his
studies undisturbed.&nbsp; Napoleon prevented its realisation by
escaping from Elba and getting the Norfolk militiamen sent to
Ireland, where sympathetic disturbances were occurring.&nbsp;
They did not embark at Harwich, however, until after the battle
of Waterloo.&nbsp; From Cork they went to Clonmel, and George had
his first taste of the fascinating country whose very name always
seemed to exercise a spell upon him.&nbsp; At Clonmel he was sent
to school, and began to learn Greek.&nbsp; What was of greater
consequence, he met a wild Irish boy, the Murtagh who figures so
finely in &ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; Murtagh taught him Erse
in return for a pack of cards.&nbsp; But even more important
still, it was here that he learned to ride on horseback and
picked up the love of horse-flesh which was one of the grand
passions of his life.&nbsp; Oh, that cob!&mdash;on which he rode
round the Devil&rsquo;s Mountain&mdash;&ldquo;may the sod lie
lightly over the bones of the strongest, speediest, and most
gallant of its kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wanderings of the elder Borrows finally ceased in
1816.&nbsp; After the Irish campaign, they returned to Norwich to
settle down, and took a house in Willow Lane.&nbsp; George, now
thirteen, was sent again to the Grammar School to receive his
first <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>regular course of &ldquo;education.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Fortunately, the process was quite unable to interfere with his
natural development.&nbsp; It was hardly possible that a boy who
had been beating about the roads and townships of the three
kingdoms ever since he could toddle, had learnt snake-charming
and the Irish language, explored the mysteries of gypsyism and
horse-dealing, and picked up such a collection of odds and ends
of lore as reposed in his retentive brain, should comfortably
abandon his vagrom modes of thought and life for the mechanical
lessons and the conventional ways of a Grammar School ruled by a
martinet.&nbsp; His wander-years had quite unfitted him for
methodical study, and he found even less interest in the common
pursuits of the school than does the average healthy rascal of
thirteen.&nbsp; Consequently, he had no soft corner in the heart
of the &ldquo;head,&rdquo; Edward Valpy, a pedagogue of the
ancient style who had no toleration for intransigence, and never
risked the spoiling of the child by any economy of the rod.</p>
<p>George had some Latin and a little Greek, picked up at
Huddersfield and Edinburgh and Clonmel, but he had probably found
Murtagh a more congenial authority than the excellent Lilly, and
his Erse was more than his Greek.&nbsp; Now that his body was
moored to the desk at Norwich, his mind wandered wantonly from
the languages he had to study to those for which, in the Valpeian
<i>r&eacute;gime</i>, there was no provision.&nbsp; With his
never-failing capacity for picking <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>up the quaintest and most
out-of-the-way people to be found about him, he made the
acquaintance of Father D&rsquo;&Eacute;terville, the
&ldquo;elderly personage . . . rather tall and something of a
robust make,&rdquo; who wore &ldquo;a snuff-coloured coat and
drab pantaloons . . . an immense frill, seldom of the purest
white, but invariably of the finest French cambric,&rdquo; and
told the young student that if he wished to be a poet he should
emulate Monsieur Boileau rather than the vagabond Dante!&nbsp;
The Rev. Thomas D&rsquo;&Eacute;terville was a French
<i>&eacute;migr&eacute;</i> who had come over in 1792, and had
qualifications from the University of Caen.&nbsp; With him George
studied French and Italian, and made a beginning of Spanish.</p>
<p>Among his contemporaries drilled and thrashed by Valpy were
several men who obtained varying degrees of fame in the world of
thought and action.&nbsp; The Grammar School boys of the time
included James Martineau, Sir Archdale Wilson, and Rajah Brooke
of Sarawak.&nbsp; Their achievements were considerable, but it
is, in one mind at all events, an open question whether
Borrow&rsquo;s did not excel them all.&nbsp; Certainly no man of
them made so many idolatrous friends, and probably no man so many
bitter enemies.</p>
<p>George was no ordinary schoolboy.&nbsp; His devotion to
learning was intense, but peculiar to himself.&nbsp; In his
boyish pranks and recreations he was just as
unconventional.&nbsp; On one occasion, the wander-fever having
seized him, he communicated it to three <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>friends of
his own age.&nbsp; They decided to run away from school, with
some wild idea of emulating the feats of his favourite Robinson
Crusoe.&nbsp; The plan, worked out by Borrow, was that they
should escape to the Norfolk coast and take any ship that would
convey them out of England.&nbsp; Till they could find some
convenient means of emigration, they proposed to conceal
themselves in a lair upon the shore, and to subsist by forays
upon the portable and comestible property of the people of the
district.&nbsp; The adventure began early in the morning and
terminated within a few hours.&nbsp; They were discovered some
dozen miles away by a gentleman who recognised one of them, and
ignominiously restored to the affection of their
parents&mdash;and the insatiable wrath of Valpy.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;head&rdquo; took Borrow, as the ringleader, and flogged
him severely.&nbsp; It was said that for this purpose the culprit
was &ldquo;horsed&rdquo; on the back of Martineau, and that the
punishment was so bad that Borrow had to keep his bed for a
fortnight.&nbsp; George could with difficulty forget a slight or
forgive an injury, real or imaginary, and Dr. Knapp declares that
he hated Martineau ever afterwards, and up to the time of his
death would never visit any house where he knew he must meet the
theologian.&nbsp; It is true that he did not care to meet
Martineau, but the reason assigned for his aversion must be given
up as a fable.&nbsp; Martineau ridiculed the story, and asserted
with every show of truth that he never &ldquo;horsed&rdquo;
Borrow.</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>Dr.
Jessopp was another of his schoolfellows.&nbsp; He has an
anecdote of Borrow appearing at school one day, his face stained
brown with walnut juice, and of Valpy, inquiring sententiously,
&ldquo;Borrow, are you suffering from jaundice, or is it only
dirt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such hours of leisure as were not occupied by
D&rsquo;&Eacute;terville and his French and Italian, or by the
explorations into Spanish and the Romany, were given up to his
worship of Nature and his devotion to sport.&nbsp; He fished in
the Yare at Earlham, and went fowling over the surrounding fields
and marshes with &ldquo;a condemned musket bearing somewhere on
its lock in rather antique characters, &lsquo;Tower,
1746.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; But, above all, he haunted Harford
Bridge.&nbsp; For at Harford Bridge did not the amazing John
Thurtell reside?&nbsp; This son of a respectable alderman of
Norwich had been in warlike adventures abroad, but now that the
wars were over had returned to his native parts to get such
entertainment out of life as a man might to whom every form of
sport came gaily welcome, and the more violent it was the more
gaily.&nbsp; So distinguished a patron of the prize-ring and so
ungenteel a gentleman was certain to make a strong appeal to
young Borrow, who made his acquaintance and acquired from him the
art of boxing.&nbsp; As we have seen, his father, the captain,
had been a bruiser when occasion demanded, and had fought Ben
Bryan.&nbsp; His fondness for the sport was hereditary.&nbsp; He
developed it during his visits to Thurtell, and <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>it never left
him.&nbsp; One of the kinds of &ldquo;canting nonsense&rdquo;
denounced in the Appendix to &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; is the
&ldquo;unmanly cant&rdquo;&mdash;a phrase in which he summed up
all objections to the practice of fisticuffs.&nbsp; His mentor in
the noble art is lightly sketched in &ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo; in
connection with the description of a prize-fight.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;terrible Thurtell, lord of the concourse,&rdquo; made a
sad ending.&nbsp; He committed the murder which inspired the
familiar ballad of &ldquo;William Weare&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He cut his throat from ear to ear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His brains he battered in;<br />
His name was Mr. William Weare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He lived in Lyon&rsquo;s Inn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thurtell induced Weare, who had relieved him of &pound;400 at
a gaming-table, to drive to Elstree in Hertfordshire, where he
disposed of him in the artistic fashion just related.&nbsp; One
of his companions turned King&rsquo;s evidence, and he was hanged
at Hertford in 1823. <a name="citation34"></a><a
href="#footnote34" class="citation">[34]</a></p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>So,
learning his grammar at school, visiting D&rsquo;&Eacute;terville
at Strangers&rsquo; Hall for French and Italian, trespassing on
the grounds of the admirable Mr. Gurney in search of fish, being
initiated into the art and mystery of pugilism, strolling to
Thorpe, and Eaton, and Cringleford, George passed two
years.&nbsp; He was fourteen when he saw the fight depicted in
&ldquo;The Zincali.&rdquo;&nbsp; The next year he was one of the
spectators at the great annual Tombland Fair, when he encountered
once more the gypsy Ambrose Smith, and went with him to the
encampment on Mousehold Heath, discoursing by the way of the
quality of beauty, as exemplified in the person of Tawno Chikno
and the earl&rsquo;s daughter who fell in love with him, and
making the acquaintance of the weird old hag &ldquo;whose name
was Herne and she came of the hairy ones.&rdquo;&nbsp; While the
gypsies remained in camp on Mousehold Heath, the lad visited them
frequently, and was introduced by Jasper&mdash;terribly angering
his mother-in-law, Mrs. Herne&mdash;into the mysteries of the
Romany language.&nbsp; His extraordinary facility in acquiring
and retaining words obtained for him the nickname of Lavengro, or
&ldquo;word-fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George left school in 1819, and was articled to the firm of
Simpson &amp; Rackham, solicitors, of Tuck&rsquo;s Court,
Norwich, apparently on the advice of his friend Roger Kerrison,
son of a substantial citizen.&nbsp; Though it is clear that he
never entertained any enthusiasm for the profession, he
diligently pursued <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>his studies at the irksome desk.&nbsp; They were not,
however, those of the law, but of languages and poetry.&nbsp; By
devoting himself to his parchments and his law books, and seeking
to fill the station of life to which he had been dedicated, he
might have made an indifferently bad country solicitor.&nbsp;
Thank heaven, nothing was further from his thoughts.&nbsp; He was
taken specially under the wing of the head of the firm, William
Simpson, then Town Clerk, and an excellent good fellow.&nbsp;
George lodged in his house in the Upper Close.&nbsp; Tuck&rsquo;s
Court, where he sat at the desk, was nearly opposite the old
Norfolk Hotel.</p>
<p>It was not long before he added another to his strange gallery
of cronies&mdash;a Welsh groom employed by a gentleman living at
the end of the court, a queer, mis-shapen man, the butt of
George&rsquo;s fellow-clerks, who hailed his every appearance
with the ballad of:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Taffy was a Welshman,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Taffy was a thief.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To Borrow, however, he was not a freak of nature, sent by a
kindly Providence to lighten the laborious hours of Simpson &amp;
Rackham&rsquo;s office, but a man who knew the Welsh language,
and might assist him in learning it.&nbsp; In return for his
help, George induced the other boys to cease their persecution,
and declared that this had the effect of releasing the Welshman
from the horns of a dilemma&mdash;for he was cogitating <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>whether
&ldquo;to hang himself from the balk of the hayloft or to give
his master warning.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he won his way into the epic
of &ldquo;Dafydd ab Gwilym&rdquo; and the songs of the Welsh
bards.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s adventures were now of a character different
from those of his schoolboy days.&nbsp; He began to enter upon
profound intellectual waters.&nbsp; His mania for languages grew
upon him.&nbsp; We have already seen him acquiring Latin, Greek,
French, Italian, Spanish, and Erse.&nbsp; He now set about Welsh,
Danish, and other tongues, and in pursuit of German he fell in
with William Taylor.&nbsp; The meeting had an important influence
upon his development.&nbsp; Taylor was a scholar of fine parts, a
man deeply versed in German literature at a time when, as
Professor Dowden has said, &ldquo;German characters were as
undecipherable to most Englishmen as Assyrian
arrow-heads.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was the friend of Southey, whom he
entertained in Norwich at the house, No. 21, King Street, which
was the resort of all the wit and learning that centred in the
city.&nbsp; Taylor found young Borrow a man after his own heart,
took to him readily, and offered to teach him German.&nbsp; It is
hardly necessary to say that George accepted such an invitation,
nor that he learnt a good deal more than German at the feet of
Taylor, whose views on most questions were advanced and
unrestricted.&nbsp; The scholar was an agnostic in matters of
religion, and an iconoclast in many sorts.&nbsp; His <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>great failing
was drunkenness: he ultimately became a sot.</p>
<p>Miss Martineau wrote that:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In Taylor&rsquo;s old age . . . his habits
of intemperance kept him out of sight of the ladies, and he got
around him a set of ignorant and conceited young men, who thought
they could set the world right by their destructive
propensities.&nbsp; One of his chief favourites was George
Borrow, as George Borrow himself has given us to
understand.&nbsp; When this polyglot gentleman appeared before
the public as a devout agent of the Bible Society in foreign
parts, there was one burst of laughter from all who remembered
the old Norwich days.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Professor Dowden has pleasantly reminded us of the delight
Harriet Martineau took in &ldquo;pricking a literary
windbag&rdquo;; sometimes she pricked more substantial things,
and her rapier broke.&nbsp; At any rate, she is hardly a good
witness on the subject of Borrow, for no love was lost between
the families.</p>
<p>And Taylor, at the time when he took up George, was a man of
some consequence in the literary world, apart from &ldquo;the
little Academe&rdquo; of Norwich.&nbsp; He knew his Kotzebue, his
Goethe, his Schiller, his Klopstock; he was in himself a
reference library of what was then outlandish knowledge.&nbsp; He
raised a bright light above the intellectual circle of the city,
in spite of the sarcasm of Harriet Martineau, who rallies his
eccentricity, his &ldquo;defences of suicide, avowals that snuff
alone had rescued him from it, information, given as certain,
that &lsquo;God Save the King&rsquo; was sung by Jeremiah in the
Temple of <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>Solomon&rdquo;&mdash;and so forth.&nbsp; But his solid
claim to consideration is good; he lives as &ldquo;the
Anglo-Germanist&rdquo; of Borrow&rsquo;s books rather than as
&ldquo;godless Billy Taylor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have taken leave to doubt that Borrow&rsquo;s melancholy was
the fruit of the theological opinions he acquired from
Taylor.&nbsp; Effort has been made to trace all his sufferings to
this association, and to the moral disintegration that is
supposed to have set in as the result of his intercourse with an
atheist.&nbsp; It seems to me an unfair and regrettable
imputation.&nbsp; Borrow was destined to go through his Werterian
period, and, child of the Celtic spirit that he was, it was bound
to be a period of acute strain and stress.&nbsp; He felt all
things intensely.&nbsp; If he had not encountered the mocking
philosophy of &ldquo;Billy Taylor&rdquo; through personal
contact, he would have met it elsewhere.&nbsp; It could no more
be missed by the youth of 1820 than by the youth of a later
century.</p>
<p>What we know with certainty of Taylor is that he was the
earliest scholar and critic to divine what there was in George
Borrow and to encourage his literary bent.&nbsp; We have to be
grateful to him for that.&nbsp; He wrote to Southey:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A Norwich young man is construing with me
Schiller&rsquo;s &lsquo;Wilhelm Tell,&rsquo; with a view of
translating it for the Press.&nbsp; His name is George Henry
Borrow, and he has learnt German with extraordinary rapidity;
indeed, he has the gift of tongues and, though not yet eighteen,
understands twelve languages&mdash;English, Welsh, Erse, Latin,
Greek, Hebrew, German, Danish, French, Italian, Spanish, and
Portuguese.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>The
catalogue of Borrow&rsquo;s languages is thus largely and rapidly
extended.&nbsp; We need not stay to inquire how he obtained them
all, nor need we assume that his acquaintance with them was in
any sense complete or scientific.&nbsp; It was probably little
more than a dictionary acquaintance; he had an extraordinary
facility for getting the rudiments of a language in a few weeks
with little more assistance than the dictionary could
supply.&nbsp; His Welsh and Danish studies are the most important
to notice here; they had a considerable influence upon the course
of his life during the few years now approaching.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ab
Gwilym&rdquo; and the ballads of the Norsemen obsessed him.</p>
<p>A personage visited Taylor at Norwich in the year 1821 to whom
this sort of young man could not fail to be interesting.&nbsp; It
was John Bowring, on a business mission to the city.&nbsp; Borrow
was a guest at a dinner party given by Taylor in July of that
year, when Bowring was present with Lewis Evans, a Welsh doctor
who had physicked the army in Spain during the Peninsular
War.&nbsp; The philological mood was strong on Borrow&mdash;and
Bowring was certainly a considerable philologist.&nbsp; He had
recently made one of his long journeys on the Continent,
combining business pains with literary joys in his accustomed
manner, and had compiled an anthology which he described as a
&ldquo;Specimen of Russian Poets.&rdquo;&nbsp; This collection it
was which inspired the present of a <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>diamond ring, conferred on him by
Alexander I.&nbsp; A man of such stamp must naturally have
appeared something of a hero in the eyes of this youth.&nbsp; Why
is it that he makes anything but a heroic figure in
Borrow&rsquo;s works?</p>
<p>Rightly or wrongly&mdash;wrongly, as I think&mdash;in after
years the &ldquo;Norwich young man&rdquo; considered himself to
have received much injury at the hands of Bowring.&nbsp;
Consequently, Bowring became the most vicious and most worthless
scoundrel that ever wore shoe-leather.&nbsp; This was
Borrow&rsquo;s way: he was a prince of haters.&nbsp; The poet and
linguist, the diplomatist, the political disciple of the
illustrious Jeremy Bentham, was melted down into the Old Radical
of the Appendix to &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; and caricatured
in the postboy&rsquo;s story at the end of
&ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; No accurate view of Bowring can be
acquired from these acerbitous descriptions; line must be altered
and colour modified with great liberality.&nbsp; Bowring may have
made pretensions that could not be sustained, but his proper
pretensions were certainly far greater than Borrow, in the
berserking spirit that possessed him twenty years afterwards, was
ready to admit.&nbsp; The polite tag with which he headed the
eleventh chapter of the Appendix was:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This very dirty man with his very dirty
face<br />
Would do any dirty act which would get him a place.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s lively account of the dinner party, written
with Archilochian bitterness, cannot be read without <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>many
reservations.&nbsp; He makes out Bowring a literary pirate and a
morally reprehensible cheat, a fraudulent ignoramus, trading for
cheap glory on other people&rsquo;s lack of knowledge, claiming
an acquaintance with languages and poetry which he does not
possess&mdash;evading conversation that will test his assertions,
and dodging all the keen questions of the young Solon who tells
the tale.&nbsp; Borrow poses him with his Red Rhys of Eryry, with
his Ghengis Khan, and with his Koran.&nbsp; Finding that Borrow
knows nothing of the Slavonic languages, Bowring immediately
becomes garrulous on the subject of Slavonic lore and
literatures; when in later years they meet again and Borrow has
the Slavonic languages at the tip of his tongue, Bowring
hurriedly changes the subject!&nbsp; That deductions have to be
made from such an account of the matter is obvious; they may well
be generous.</p>
<p>It is clear that, at the time, the young man entertained none
of these opinions about Bowring, for he sought his help in a
troublesome period of his own life, and was ready to engage in a
literary collaboration with him.&nbsp; What actually happened was
that, as a result of this meeting at the hospitable board of
William Taylor, Borrow was induced to pursue even with greater
ardour than before his translations from the Celtic and the Norse
languages.&nbsp; It may have been largely a waste of time.&nbsp;
Possibly George would have done better either by sticking to his
law books or by cultivating his bent for original composition; <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>but that was
no fault of Bowring, from whom he received inspiration and
encouragement in a course of study that was exceedingly congenial
to him.</p>
<p>He went on delving in the musty old folios of the Corporation
Library.&nbsp; Their yellow pages were more precious to him than
aught in the world; the songs he puzzled out of the &ldquo;Danica
Literatura&rdquo; were sweeter than the</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Celestial
syrens&rsquo; harmony<br />
That sit upon the nine enfolded spheres.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>True delight to him was the acquisition of Anglo-Saxon, the
improvement of his Welsh and Scandinavian; the sum and crown of
bliss was to pore over Llhuyd&rsquo;s &ldquo;Arch&aelig;ologia
Britannica&rdquo; and to translate Olaus Wormius&mdash;of whom he
became so desperately fond that in a fit of youthful freakishness
he adopted the signature &ldquo;George Olaus Borrow.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His pencilled notes are still to be seen on the margins of the
ancient tomes so generously handed over to his tender mercies by
the city authorities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, piles of notebooks and manuscripts were growing in
the house in the Upper Close; the rhymed translation of &ldquo;Ab
Gwilym&rdquo; and English versions of the old Norse ballads were
proceeding laboriously but steadily.&nbsp; To the industry of the
bookworm was added the passion of the author.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ab
Gwilym,&rdquo; Olaus Wormius, and William Taylor in the aggregate
were far too strong an influence for worthy Mr. Simpson of
Tuck&rsquo;s Court to counteract.&nbsp; <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Wigs and
parchment could not stand against philology and poetry.&nbsp;
Whatever notions Borrow ever entertained about pursuing the law
as a profession gradually paled before the <i>furor
scribendi</i>.&nbsp; Thomas Campbell was editing Colburn&rsquo;s
<i>New Monthly</i>, and Taylor wrote to him on behalf of
Borrow.&nbsp; The result was the appearance in the magazine of a
rhymed English version of Schiller&rsquo;s ballad, &ldquo;Der
Taucher,&rdquo; which was signed &ldquo;G. O. B.&rdquo;&mdash;the
&ldquo;O&rdquo; standing for the Olaus of his adoption.&nbsp;
This represented all that Campbell did for him.&nbsp; Borrow was
more successful with Sir Richard Phillips, the editor and
proprietor of <i>The Monthly Magazine</i>, to whom his name was
also introduced by Taylor.&nbsp; In the late months of 1823
several poetical translations appeared in the
<i>Monthly</i>.&nbsp; It must be confessed that they hardly
reached even to the merit of mediocrity.&nbsp; During the same
period Borrow was hard at work translating Klinger&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Faustus&rdquo; and other matters.&nbsp; It was not a
sanitary life for a youth of twenty.&nbsp; The inevitable
consequences were ill-health, morbid melancholy, and a
particularly turbid period of Werterism, during which threats of
suicide were frequent.&nbsp; All this has been laid at the door
of William Taylor.&nbsp; It would be far more appropriate to
charge it upon Klinger, Olaus Wormius, and Ab Gwilym.&nbsp;
Borrow contrived very effectually &ldquo;to suck melancholy out
of a song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, of course, was very unsatisfactory preparation <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>for the
career of a respectable solicitor in a cathedral city.&nbsp; His
father protested in vain.&nbsp; Before the noble old captain
died, leaving the brothers dependent on their own resources
(since he had been able to make provision only just sufficient
for his widow), George had decided that his association with the
law should be determined at the same time as his
apprenticeship.&nbsp; Roger Kerrison had already departed to
London, and Borrow wrote to him there:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If ever my health mends, and possibly it
may by the time my clerkship expires, I intend to live in London,
write plays, poetry, etc., abuse religion, and get myself
prosecuted; for I would not for an ocean of gold remain any
longer than I am forced in this dull and gloomy town.&rdquo; <a
name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s father died on February 28th, 1824.&nbsp; A
month later, within a day or two of the expiry of his articles,
George was on the coach bound for London, accompanied by a little
green box full of manuscripts, and in his pocket a letter of
introduction from William Taylor to Sir Richard Phillips, the
publisher.&nbsp; He had burnt his legal boats and destroyed his
youthful bridges; he was fairly started upon the literary
life.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">PUBLISHER&rsquo;S HACK AND
HEDGESMITH</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Borrow&rsquo;s</span>
&ldquo;literary&rdquo; life in London&mdash;where he lodged at
16, Millman Street, Bedford Row, with his friend
Kerrison&mdash;was a period of the deadliest and most miserable
drudgery.&nbsp; No author is a man of genius to his publisher, as
Heine tells us.&nbsp; Borrow was certainly not a man of genius to
Sir Richard Phillips, and their association for about ten months
was a time of strain and irritation to both.&nbsp; Consequently,
in Borrow&rsquo;s opinion, Barabbas was Sir Richard
Phillips.&nbsp; He lives only as &ldquo;the publisher&rdquo; in
&ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; in which he is pictured as a subject fit
merely for the odium and execration of the human race.&nbsp;
Discount from this estimate of Sir Richard is highly
necessary.&nbsp; He appears to have been a moderately inoffensive
person, whose chief weakness was metaphysics, and a
worse-assorted pair than he and Borrow it would be hard to
imagine.</p>
<p>What was the literary ammunition with which Borrow expected to
bring the publisher of <i>The Monthly Magazine</i> to his
feet?&nbsp; It consisted wholly of translations and
versifications.&nbsp; Their intrinsic merit was very slight, and
there was no market for <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>them.&nbsp; Some might be useful to
fill up an odd corner, but they were certainly no staple
commodity for a person intending to get a living by
literature.&nbsp; Under the combined disadvantage of unmarketable
wares and an uncongenial temperament, Borrow might well have
considered himself lucky to be taken on by Phillips as a factotum
to do the scavenging of his business.&nbsp; But while they were
together the youth tasted the bitterest cup and fed on the
hardest crust that Grub Street had to offer to the worshippers of
the Muses.&nbsp; It had been more humane if Phillips had repeated
to Borrow the advice which Mr. Wilcox, the bookseller, offered to
Dr. Johnson when he proposed to live as an author: &ldquo;You had
better buy a porter&rsquo;s knot.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hard physical
exertion would have served him better than the labour he endured,
this child of The Wild, cooped up in London compiling criminal
records or translating philosophical treatises into the German
language.</p>
<p>Phillips had just retired from the business of pure
publishing, which was a gloomy fact in the prospect of
Borrow&rsquo;s cargo of ballads.&nbsp; He retained <i>The Monthly
Magazine</i>, it was true, and had started a pretentious
periodical under the resounding title of <i>The Universal Review
or Chronicle of the Literature of all Nations</i>, apparently in
the hope&mdash;which proved vain&mdash;that it would provide a
career for his son.&nbsp; This was the <i>Oxford Review</i> which
figures in the pages of &ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; The actual
editor was the <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>redoubtable William Gifford, and the work of which
superfluous copies lay about on the floor in such prodigal
profusion was his translation of Juvenal.&nbsp; The incongruity
of such an atmosphere for the kind of genius that possessed young
Borrow!&nbsp; With a pathetic belief in the potency of Danish
ballads to move the stoniest heart and draw guineas from the
tightest purse, he introduced the subject.&nbsp; Phillips would
have none of it, and when his visitor began to declaim of</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Buckshank bold and Elphinstone,<br />
And more than I can mention here,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he stopped him, saying that &ldquo;it was very pretty indeed,
and beat Scott hollow, and Percy too&rdquo;&mdash;but nobody then
cared for Percy, nor for Scott either, save as a novelist.&nbsp;
If Borrow could produce something which should rival the merits
of &ldquo;The Dairyman&rsquo;s Daughter,&rdquo; by Legh Richmond,
there might be a chance of doing business.&nbsp; The young
aspirant for literary fame searched London for a copy of the book
which he was recommended to imitate, and, when he found it,
discovered that he could by no possibility do anything like it,
for it was a religious book, &ldquo;written from the
heart,&rdquo; and Borrow had to confess to the publisher that he
did not know much about religion in an intimate way.&nbsp; The
only thing to do was to accept that which the publisher was
prepared to offer him, the task of reviewing books for the <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>new
periodical, and of collating records of &ldquo;Celebrated
Trials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another enterprise was undertaken by Borrow, which in itself
was sufficient to prove his undoing even if the life had been
congenial to him.&nbsp; Phillips was the author of a work of
philosophy entitled &ldquo;The Proximate Causes of the Material
Phenomena of the Universe.&rdquo;&nbsp; In an ill moment the new
recruit engaged to translate this portentous tome into German for
publication.&nbsp; Shades of Olaus Wormius and Ab Gwilym!&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s German was the first stumbling-block.&nbsp; It was
good enough to enable him to read German works and to turn German
into English, but to work with it as a colloquial tongue was
quite a different matter.&nbsp; In this respect he had contracted
to do the impossible.&nbsp; But even if his German had been
perfect he would have been a fish out of water, for he knew
nothing of metaphysics.&nbsp; This is not the place to discuss
the value of Sir Richard Phillips&rsquo;s book, which has
doubtless taken up some dusty nook on a library shelf for its
permanent and undisturbed place of residence.&nbsp; But it was
enough for Borrow to be told that nobody could understand his
German version: in his opinion the cause of that did not reside
so much in his imperfect acquaintance with the language as in the
folly of the author.&nbsp; Borrow did not understand him and his
terminology; consequently, the theories and the language of Sir
Richard Phillips were equally absurd.&nbsp; The contumely <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>poured upon
the publisher in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; was probably not fully
deserved.&nbsp; A German edition of the Philosophy, translated by
Theobald and Lebret, appeared at Stuttgart in 1826, and, for what
it was worth, the Germans succeeded in understanding this.&nbsp;
But, for the rest, if Borrow was treated no worse than other
publishers&rsquo; hacks were treated, his lot was no more
pleasant.&nbsp; Phillips was exigent about the work for which he
paid so meanly, and none too kindly in his manner.&nbsp; Even
about the &ldquo;Celebrated Trials,&rdquo; which was the
enterprise George liked best of them all, Borrow was worried in
an unconscionable fashion.</p>
<p>Of course, there was another life than this: his own private
life, his intercourse with such friends as he had already in
London and with the new acquaintances he made during his
unconventional wanderings about the city.&nbsp; His brother John,
the artist, reached London on April 29th, commissioned to induce
Benjamin Haydon to paint the portrait of a Mr. Robert Hawkes, who
was Mayor of Norwich in 1822.&nbsp; John had been asked to do the
portrait himself, but distrusted his powers and preferred that
the commission should go to Haydon.&nbsp; George went with his
brother to interview &ldquo;the painter of the Heroic,&rdquo; who
was not by way of painting provincial mayors as a matter of
preference, but was in the chronic state of impecuniosity which
made the fee of a hundred pounds an irresistible bait.&nbsp; The
mission was successful.&nbsp; <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>Haydon went down to Norwich, and
executed a portrait of the worthy Mr. Hawkes &ldquo;striding
under a Norman arch out of the cathedral.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Norman
arch seems to have been suggested locally, and it appealed
strongly to Haydon&rsquo;s sense of the grandiose, though many
people may be inclined to agree with George that the mayors of
the day, as a rule, would have been better painted issuing from
The Chequers or The Brewers Three.</p>
<p>Whatever distractions he could discover or invent,
Borrow&rsquo;s life was miserable, and brought on severe attacks
of melancholia, which he first described as &ldquo;the
Horrors&rdquo; and afterwards as &ldquo;the Fear.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What a life!&nbsp; What a dog&rsquo;s life!&rdquo; he
tells us he would exclaim after &ldquo;escaping&rdquo; from the
presence of the publisher.&nbsp; His woes, real and
imaginary&mdash;and a great many of them were the effect of his
morbid imaginings&mdash;drove him to desperate thoughts.&nbsp;
After his brother&rsquo;s visit, Knapp tells us, he wrote to
Kerrison: &ldquo;Dear Roger,&mdash;Come to me immediately.&nbsp;
I believe I am dying.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was probably very far from
dying, but Kerrison had an idea that George was liable to
suicidal impulses, did not like assuming the responsibility for
such an irresponsible person, and shifted his lodgings.&nbsp; The
mood passed, and Borrow went on hawking his ballads among the
publishers of London with no more success than before.&nbsp; He
relates how he called on &ldquo;glorious John&rdquo; twenty times
without success.&nbsp; We are not to place too much <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>reliance upon
the exactitude of this statement.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the
&ldquo;Celebrated Trials&rdquo; was going on.&nbsp; It was a
tremendous compilation, with little of Borrow&rsquo;s own work in
it.&nbsp; Its 3,600 pages represented nearly a year&rsquo;s
adventures among the bookstalls and the files of old newspapers
and fly-sheets.&nbsp; One piece of characteristic literary work
with which he endowed the world was his translation of
Klinger&rsquo;s &ldquo;Faustus,&rdquo; which shortly
appeared.&nbsp; This had been done at Norwich in the Simpson
&amp; Rackham days.&nbsp; Finally, the book of
&ldquo;Trials&rdquo; was completed, and the <i>Universal
Review</i> died of inanition.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did not like
reviewing at all . . . I never could understand why reviews were
instituted,&rdquo; says Lavengro.&nbsp; And he continued to
detest reviewers and reviewing to the end of his days.&nbsp; In
1853, when Whitwell Elwin was deputising for Lockhart as editor
of the <i>Quarterly</i>, he met Borrow.&nbsp; Their interview,
Elwin&rsquo;s son tells us, was characteristic of both:
&ldquo;Borrow was just then very sore with his slashing critics,
and, on someone mentioning that Elwin was a <i>quartering</i>
reviewer, he said, &lsquo;Sir, I wish you a better
employment!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the death of the <i>Universal Review</i>, his relations
with Phillips came to an end.&nbsp; He had little money and no
resources.&nbsp; Once more he resumed the weary round, tramping
in search of purchasers for his translations, and gradually
approaching a condition of penury, but maintaining his attitude
of aggression and independence.&nbsp; It is into this brief
period that <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>he has worked some of the most effective scenes of
&ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; the friendship with the old apple-woman
who had a stall on London Bridge, and with the Armenian merchant
to whom he suggested that his wealth should be devoted to the
liberation and aggrandisement of Armenia.&nbsp; Languages and
poetry still obsessed his dreams.&nbsp; But audacious poverty at
last bit a deeper wound than could be salved by poetry, and he
resolved, only just too late, to accept an engagement the
Armenian had offered him.&nbsp; It was sharp upon his
disappointment at finding that the Armenian had taken him at his
word, and gone away bent upon the conquest of Persia, that,
returning from an excursion to Greenwich, Blackheath, and
Shooter&rsquo;s Hill, in the course of which he came upon the
&ldquo;Petulengros&rdquo; in camp, he saw a notice in a
bookseller&rsquo;s window, &ldquo;Wanted, a Novel or
Tale.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; relates how he shut
himself up from the 13th to the 18th of May, and wrote &ldquo;The
Life and Adventures of Joseph Sell,&rdquo; which he sold to the
bookseller for twenty pounds.</p>
<p>How much of all this is truth and how much is fiction it is
difficult to determine.&nbsp; There is probably a basis of fact
for it.&nbsp; Borrow, with all his imagination and all his
romance, was not an inventive writer, and though the idea of
&ldquo;Joseph Sell&rdquo; may have been suggested by the history
of &ldquo;Rasselas,&rdquo; it is more probable that by some
stroke of luck of this kind he did obtain the money with which to
set out on his <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>tour of the English roads.&nbsp; The circumstance that
no &ldquo;Life of Joseph Sell&rdquo; has ever been discovered is
nothing to set against this probability, and against the feeling
with which Lavengro narrates its inception and
accomplishment.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s love of mystification
entirely accounts for it.&nbsp; There was a choice between saying
exactly what he did, what his tale or history was entitled, and
obscuring the whole matter by a fictitious name; and it would not
have been Borrow if he had not chosen the latter course.&nbsp; By
whatever work, he did obtain money enough to allow him to shake
the dust of London off his shoes and begin those wanderings
through English rural districts which provided the adventures
described in the second and better half of
&ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow was big and strong and a magnificent walker; never
before, as Mr. Watts-Dunton has said, had there appeared on
English roads so majestic-looking a tramp, with bundle and
stick.&nbsp; He went south-west to Salisbury Plain, and there is
a powerful account in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; of sunrise at
Stonehenge.&nbsp; The only thing to compare with it is Thomas
Hardy&rsquo;s prose-poem of the same magical place by
moonlight.&nbsp; One cannot read without a thrill the passage
where, &ldquo;taking off my hat I advanced slowly, and cast
myself with my face upon the dewy earth in the middle of the
portal of giants.&nbsp; The spirit of Stonehenge was strong upon
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is little, of importance to Borrow&rsquo;s own life, <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>to decipher
in the story of his wayfaring which is not incorporated in the
book itself.&nbsp; Perhaps one of the most weird of his
adventures was the encounter with the scholar and gentleman
afflicted by the &ldquo;touching&rdquo; mania; one of the most
sensational the attempt made by Mrs. Herne, the gypsy crone, to
poison him with a doctored cake; one of the most impressive his
meeting with the Welsh Methodist preacher, Peter Williams, and
his wife, Winifred&mdash;Peter Williams who suffered tortures
untold because he imagined that in his boyhood he had committed
the sin against the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; He met Romanist
missionaries, who at that time were very active on the highways
and byways of England; dog-fighters and prize-fighters;
everywhere out-of-the-way adventures occurred to him.&nbsp; He
bought the stock-in-trade of Jack Slingsby, a hedgesmith and
tinker, who was afraid to remain on the roads because of the
enmity of the terrible bully, Blazing Bosvile, alias the Flaming
Tinman; and in the course of his wanderings in search of
business, he pulled up in Mumper&rsquo;s Dingle, where was
enacted the romance of Isopel Berners.&nbsp; The scene is said to
have been identified as Mumber Lane, near Willenhall, in
Staffordshire.</p>
<p>In all the writings of Borrow there is but one episode of
love.&nbsp; This romantic wanderer, so far as he informs us or we
can ascertain, had been only once in love in nearly forty years,
and that for a <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>few weeks; nor was he then so deeply immersed that he
took any particular pains to bring the lady to his own way of
thinking.&nbsp; But this one episode has endowed English
literature with a figure which takes a proud place in the gallery
of fair women, the figure of Isopel Berners.&nbsp; Like
everything else in Lavengro&rsquo;s life, his sweetheart must be
remarkable, his courtship must be unconventional, the adventure
must have a vague and misty ending.</p>
<p>Watch Isopel as she descends, with her donkey and cart, behind
the Flaming Tinman and Moll, his mort, into Mumper&rsquo;s
Dingle, where Lavengro has camped.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dashing past the other horse and cart,
which by this time had reached the bottom of the pass, appeared
an exceedingly tall woman&mdash;or rather girl, for she could
scarcely have been above eighteen.&nbsp; She was dressed in a
tight bodice and a blue stuff gown; hat, bonnet, or cap she had
none, and her hair, which was flaxen, hung down on her shoulders
unconfined; her complexion was fair, and her features handsome,
with a determined but open expression.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In conversation with the Flaming Tinman, who is working
himself up to the proper pitch of a quarrel with the amateur
tinker, the tall girl remarks that she would engage to thrash
that weedy-looking youth with one hand.&nbsp; Forth bursts
Lavengro, with his eternal Norse lore: &ldquo;&lsquo;You might
beat me with no hands at all,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;fair damsel,
only by looking at me&mdash;I never saw such a face and
figure&mdash;both regal&mdash;why, you look like Ingeborg, Queen
of Norway; <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>she had twelve brothers, and could lick them all, though
they were heroes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;On Dovrefeld, in Norway,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were once together seen<br />
The twelve heroic brothers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Ingeborg, the queen!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A pretty invocation, indeed, to a hawker travelling with a
donkey-cart!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;None of your chaffing, young fellow,&rdquo;
said the tall girl, &ldquo;or I will give you what shall make you
wipe your face; be civil, or you will rue it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lavengro admitted that he was &ldquo;perhaps a peg too
high,&rdquo; and offered her &ldquo;something a bit
lower.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a Romany couplet.&nbsp; The rage of
the tall girl, whilom Queen Ingeborg, may be imagined when she
found herself associated with the gypsies; there is no despite of
gypsies quite so deep as that of the English of the &ldquo;lower
orders,&rdquo; as they might say at Marlborough.&nbsp; And, after
a little more of Lavengro&rsquo;s solemn chaff: &ldquo;Before I
could put myself on guard, she struck me a blow on the face which
had nearly brought me to the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fit exordium to the love-story of travelling hawker and
hedge-tinker, to be promoted later by lessons in Armenian given
by the Knight of the Solder-iron to the Damsel of the
Donkey-cart.&nbsp; And the scene that
follows&mdash;Lavengro&rsquo;s fight with the Flaming Tinman, who
transferred his mortal enmity for Jack Slingsby <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>to the
temporary owner of Jack Slingsby&rsquo;s stock-in-trade&mdash;is
a fit sequel.&nbsp; The heroic combat was the real beginning of
the courtship.&nbsp; &ldquo;The tall girl&rdquo; saw foul play on
the part of the Tinman, and immediately became &ldquo;the young
man&rsquo;s&rdquo; champion and assumed the office of his
second.&nbsp; It was by her advice, after he had been knocked off
his legs several times by the Tinman&rsquo;s flashing fist, that,
instead of fighting with his left, he got in the blow with his
&ldquo;long right&rdquo; that settled the hash of Blazing
Bosvile.&nbsp; The Tinman and his mort took themselves off after
this discomfiture, leaving Lavengro and Isopel Berners in
undisputed possession of the Dingle.</p>
<p>We learn little about Isopel in details of fact, except that
she was born in &ldquo;Long Melford workhouse,&rdquo; and put
&ldquo;out to service,&rdquo; where she experienced all the joys
that were usually stored up in service for workhouse girls in the
early part of the nineteenth century.&nbsp; When her mistress
attempted to knock her down with a besom, Belle knocked down the
mistress with her fist.&nbsp; So she went back to the Great
House, was put in a dark cell, and fed for a fortnight on bread
and water.&nbsp; At her next essay to serve she was no more
fortunate; this time she knocked down her master for being rude
to her, and had to fly the house.&nbsp; A travelling hawkeress,
going the roads with silk and linen, took a fancy to her, and
carried her on many journeys.&nbsp; Belle protected <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>her from
insult and violence; in return the old woman, at her death, left
the girl her stock.&nbsp; She was thus in business on her own
account, and casually travelling with the Bosviles, when she fell
in with Lavengro.</p>
<p>In his erratic way, Borrow paints a charming idyll of the few
succeeding weeks during which they lived in the Dingle: an idyll
of natural beauty, and a picture of such womanly modesty and
strength of character as to make Isopel Berners one of the
heroines the heart cherishes.&nbsp; The uneducated Amazon, the
feminine pugilist, who can take her own part in any quarrel, is
by nature a modest girl, a woman with the finest perceptions and
the most delicate instincts; she has a vein of poetry in her
composition which gives her a certain affinity with the wandering
philologist, who has in turn a vein of chivalry in his.&nbsp;
While she dwells in her tent and he in his, while she goes up and
down the neighbourhood on her business, and Lavengro stays in the
Dingle to make new shoes for her donkey, Isopel is all the time
dreaming what might have been.&nbsp; For all his chivalry, the
young man is strange and plain-spoken, rarely paying a
compliment, never making an advance, boring her with philological
disquisitions, talking of things indifferent to her, pestering
her with Armenian declensions, or sitting dull and silent while
he sips the tea she has made for him.&nbsp; Here is a
characteristic passage:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>&ldquo;I took another cup; we were again silent.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is rather uncomfortable,&rsquo; said I at last,
&lsquo;for people to sit together without having anything to
say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Were you thinking of your company?&rsquo; said
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What company?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The present company.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The present company?&nbsp; Oh, ah!&mdash;I
remember that I said one only feels uncomfortable in being silent
with a companion when one happens to be thinking of the
companion.&nbsp; Well, I had been thinking of you the last two or
three minutes, and had just come to the conclusion that, to
prevent us both feeling occasionally uncomfortable towards each
other, having nothing to say, it would be as well to have a
standing subject on which to employ our tongues.&nbsp; Belle, I
have determined to give you lessons in
Armenian.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which he proceeds forthwith to do.&nbsp; What was a girl to
make of a man like that?&nbsp; When that Lavengro&rsquo;s heart
was sore thereafter for the lack of Belle Berners, he had to
thank his moroseness and his Armenian nouns for it.</p>
<p>So proceeded, without passion, without even a symptom of
philandering on either side, the Romance of Mumper&rsquo;s
Dell&mdash;dreadfully misunderstood by the postilion who
sheltered there in the thunderstorm, and by Mrs. Chikno when the
gypsies encamped near by&mdash;but never advancing, so far as the
two chief actors were concerned.&nbsp; It is continued from the
last volume of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; into the first volume of
the &ldquo;Romany Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the latter, for a hundred
pages we are waiting upon some development of it; but it is as
elusive as a pixy.&nbsp; We continually tremble upon the brink of
a declaration.&nbsp; Take this scene, powerful <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>but
inconclusive.&nbsp; Upon the departure of Mr. and Mrs.
Petulengro, after their visit of ceremony:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Then you are going?&rdquo; said I, when
Belle and I were left alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;I am going on a journey;
my affairs compel me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will return again?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;I shall return once
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once more,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean
by once more?&nbsp; The Petulengros will soon be gone; and will
you abandon me in this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were alone here,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;before I
came, and I suppose you found it agreeable, or you would not have
stayed in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was before I knew
you; but having lived with you here, I should be very loth to
live here without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did not know
that I was of so much consequence to you.&nbsp; Well&mdash;the
day is wearing away&mdash;I must go and harness Traveller to the
cart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He does some little service for her, as harnessing the donkey
and putting the bundles into the cart.&nbsp; The narrative
proceeds, and the chapter ends thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I put the bundles into the cart, and then
led Traveller and the cart up the winding path to the mouth of
the dingle.&nbsp; Belle followed.&nbsp; At the top I delivered
the reins into her hands, we looked at each other steadfastly for
some time.&nbsp; Belle then departed, and I returned to the
dingle, where, seating myself on my stone, I remained for upwards

<p>Great is ellipsis&mdash;but romance cannot live by ellipsis
alone.&nbsp; The next chapter begins, &ldquo;On the following
morning,&rdquo; and is a spirited account of a feast of roast
sucking-pig in the gypsy encampment!</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>There
is never room for a doubt that Lavengro was by this time fairly
in love with Belle.&nbsp; But there is also no room for doubt
that Belle had realised that he was not for her, nor was she for
him.&nbsp; Their ways lay apart.&nbsp; Belle&rsquo;s way was the
broad road of the Atlantic to America, where she hoped to conduct
her life free from the disadvantages that attended the career in
England of a workhouse girl with a name which, as Lavengro had
told her, belonged to the nomenclatures of the ancient
aristocracy.&nbsp; His way was through many strange lands,
through a life of adventure and turmoil, to an old age of mingled
glory, hypochondria, and megrims.&nbsp; So that Belle had
resolved to nip the romance in the bud, and her last journey from
the Dingle was made with the purpose of selling her donkey and
cart and her silks and linens, and going to Liverpool to take
ship for the New World.&nbsp; She returned once more, as she had
promised.&nbsp; It was late at night; Lavengro was asleep in his
tent; but he had banked up the fire, and placed the kettle over
it.&nbsp; The little noise of her arrival woke him, and he
dressed so as to go out and unharness her donkey.&nbsp; Now that
it was all impossible, and Belle had made her irrevocable
decision, Lavengro, of course, came to the point.&nbsp; On their
last day together, he set her conjugating the Armenian verb
<i>siriel</i>, and when he had worried her through it, told her
that the English equivalent of <i>siriel</i> was &ldquo;to
love.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, in his whimsical, <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>moonshiny,
teasing way, having driven Isopel to tears, he suddenly proposed
to her that they should be off together to America, settle down
in some forest, and conjugate the verb <i>siriel</i>
conjugally!</p>
<p>And, as there was never a doubt that Lavengro had managed to
get himself in love with Belle, so there was never a doubt that
Belle was strongly tempted to acknowledge that she loved this
strange fellow of six feet three with the black eyes and the
white hair and the long right arm, who could beat Blazing Bosvile
and make donkey shoes, and mend kettles and talk all the
languages that were heard in the Tower of Babel.&nbsp; But well
for Belle&rsquo;s peace of mind that she resisted the temptation;
for Lavengro, the constitutional wanderer, would have led her a
pretty life when they had buried themselves in the depths of an
American forest to conjugate Armenian verbs!</p>
<p>The next morning he set off with his friend Jasper for a horse
fair, leaving Belle behind.&nbsp; &ldquo;On arriving at the
extremity of the plain, I looked towards the dingle.&nbsp; Isopel
Berners stood at the mouth; the beams of the early morning sun
shone full on her noble face and figure.&nbsp; I waved my hand
towards her.&nbsp; She slowly lifted up her right arm.&nbsp; I
turned away, and never saw Isopel Berners again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For while Lavengro was away Belle departed from the Dingle,
and left never a trace behind her.&nbsp; Now that he had lost the
treasure upon which he had set <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>so small a price, Lavengro was very
sore at heart, and would have given much to recall her and to
consummate his day-dreams.&nbsp; But all that he ever heard of
her again was in a letter addressed by her to &ldquo;the young
man in Mumper&rsquo;s Dingle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Herein she explained
why she had refused his offer, which, if he had made it in the
early part of their acquaintance, she would have accepted.&nbsp;
She proffered him some very good advice about his manners, told
him she thought he was a bit mad at bottom, gave him a lock of
her glorious hair, and left this maxim with him: &ldquo;Fear God,
and take your own part.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which was so much to
Lavengro&rsquo;s liking that he made it the motto of the second
portion of his life-story, &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo;; and
there it is to this day under his name, and over the imprint of
Mr. Murray.</p>
<p>Was Isopel Berners a reality, and did Borrow meet her in
Mumper&rsquo;s Dingle?&nbsp; Or is the whole of this history an
invention?&nbsp; Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s elaborate researches do not
help us much, because there is no documentary evidence about the
episode.&nbsp; He can merely tell us that Borrow did make such a
journey, did buy a tinker&rsquo;s stock-in-trade, and did live in
Mumper&rsquo;s Dingle.&nbsp; So that we must look for internal
evidence.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that Isopel Berners was a reality, and a very
substantial one; I have no doubt that she was extraordinarily
tall, strong, and beautiful; and that her hair was wonderfully
fine.&nbsp; I do not <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>insist that she was either as tall,
as strong, or as beautiful as she is painted in
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;; for Shorsha had a habit of
exaggerating&mdash;it was one of the many constitutional defects
of his character; he could not help it.</p>
<p>The reason is very simple for this faith about Isopel Berners,
the prototype of Queen Ingeborg, who, as Mr. Birrell has said,
need fear comparison with no damsel that ever lent sweetness to
the stage, relish to rhyme, or life to novels.&nbsp; Borrow never
created a character.&nbsp; He has left many portraits; but to
imagine an Isopel Berners, to invent the incident, was as
impossible for him as flying.&nbsp; The romance of Isopel Berners
would never have been written if George Borrow, when he was
travelling England on foot upon the money he earned by writing
&ldquo;Joseph Sell&rdquo; and by mending kettles, had not met
Isopel&rsquo;s prototype in Mumper&rsquo;s Dingle.</p>
<p>The adventures of the rest of this year of 1825 may be told
very briefly.&nbsp; Borrow left the Dingle when it appeared
certain that he would see no more of Isopel, and, with money
borrowed from Jasper Petulengro&mdash;or rather forced by his
gypsy friend upon an unwilling recipient&mdash;bought a fine
horse and set off wandering again.&nbsp; His roadside encounters,
with the bee-keeper and brewer of mead, with the gentleman who
had learnt Chinese by the aid of the hieroglyphics on teapots,
and all the rest of them, being more or less impersonal and
extraneous to his <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>own history, may be left for consideration in connection
with &ldquo;The Romany Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp; He took a situation for
a time as assistant in a stable-yard at a coaching
inn&mdash;having abandoned the tinker&rsquo;s craft and given the
pony and stock-in-trade to his gypsy friends,&mdash;ultimately
sold his horse at Horncastle Fair, and tramped back to Norwich,
where his mother was living.</p>

67</span>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BORROW AND BOWRING</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> now have Borrow a youth of
twenty-two.&nbsp; His life has been full of weird adventure, but
to all appearances quite unprofitable in any worldly sense.&nbsp;
His future is nebulous.&nbsp; Dreams are dreamed; visions are
vanished.&nbsp; He seems to be farther from fame and fortune than
when he set off in the coach for London, with the green box in
the boot carrying his Danish ballads and his &ldquo;Ab
Gwilym.&rdquo;&nbsp; His castles in the clouds have come crashing
to earth in irremediable ruin.</p>
<p>Borrow was indignant with a scurvy world which had treated him
harshly.&nbsp; The plain truth was that the world had no feeling
about him at all, one way or the other.&nbsp; He had nothing to
sell that anybody wanted to buy, and no means of making a
living.&nbsp; He had a long road to travel before he found
himself.&nbsp; In 1825 he went home to Norwich a failure, with
the sense of defeat very strong upon him.&nbsp; The mother who
was at once his best adviser and sincerest worshipper was not
likely to chide his folly as the father had done.&nbsp; She was
ready to receive him with demonstrations of love, and to share
her little with <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>him.&nbsp; This was part of the ignominy which he
hated&mdash;that he was obliged to impose himself upon the
household in Willow Lane.&nbsp; In a world out of joint, the
cursed spite was that he could do nothing to set it right.</p>
<p>Long time he struggled hard to lift himself out of this
rut.&nbsp; He continued to fail.&nbsp; When at last he did
succeed, these years became to him a horrible nightmare.&nbsp; He
would not speak of them; he tried not to think of them.&nbsp; He
resolutely refused to permit the public a glimpse into the sordid
secrets they contained.&nbsp; From 1825 to 1832 he lived a life
of which he wished nobody to know anything.&nbsp; Out of some
correspondence between him and Richard Ford arose the phrase,
&ldquo;the Veiled Period.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ford implored him to lift
the veil a little and allow his admirers to know what he was
doing.&nbsp; There were many reasons why he declined to do
so.&nbsp; He endeavoured to puzzle the public about it, and
perhaps succeeded partly in mystifying himself.&nbsp; He
suggested a kind of vague romance of wanderings in remote parts
of Europe.&nbsp; Some of the suggestions were founded on a slight
basis of fact; that is all that can be said for them.</p>
<p>As to the facts: there is no doubt that he did buy a horse
with money lent to him by Ambrose Smith, and sell it at a
profit.&nbsp; As in the case of Isopel, it may not be unwise to
allow some discount off the published accounts of the
transaction.&nbsp; Very possibly the horse <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>was not such
a fine horse as that noble animal with whose assistance Lavengro
electrified the jockeys at Horncastle Fair; perhaps the profit on
the sale was not so great as it was made to appear in &ldquo;The
Romany Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp; But there was such a transaction.&nbsp;
Ambrose Smith reminded him of it, long years afterwards, when he
visited the great author at Oulton.</p>
<p>Soon after his return to Norwich, he was busy again about his
literary schemes.&nbsp; He tried to sell copies of his
translation of Klinger, which he took from the publisher in lieu
of payment for the work.&nbsp; While with Phillips in London, he
had projected a volume of poetical translations of Danish
ballads.&nbsp; The plan then came to naught.&nbsp; Now he printed
the book in Norwich by subscription, after a correspondence with
Allan Cunningham about it.&nbsp; Cunningham was full of
admiration for the old songs drawn from the &ldquo;Kjaempe
Viser.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Swayne Vonved&rdquo; was his
favourite, and it remained Borrow&rsquo;s own pet throughout
life.&nbsp; Five hundred copies of the &ldquo;Romantic
Ballads&rdquo; were printed, of which 200 were subscribed
for.&nbsp; These, at ten and sixpence a copy, paid all the
expenses of the issue.&nbsp; There was an arrangement under which
the London publisher, John Taylor, took the rest and placed his
imprint on the title-page.&nbsp; Cunningham gave the young poet a
great deal of good advice about promoting the interests of the
book.&nbsp; He neglected it, with characteristic
self-sufficiency.&nbsp; <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>He had published ballads, and if the
great public did not share Mopsa&rsquo;s affection for ballads in
print, the nineteenth-century Autolycus could not help it, and
would be content with what he could get out of the local
subscribers in Norwich.</p>
<p>In 1826 he was in London, and in correspondence with Benjamin
Haydon about sitting for a figure in one of his
pictures&mdash;possibly the &ldquo;Mock Election.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
the course of the correspondence Borrow speaks of proceeding
presently to the South of France.&nbsp; This is the first hint of
those brief travels on the Continent which became magnified by
the pervading haze into world-wide wanderings.&nbsp; &ldquo;Were
you ever at Kiachta?&rdquo; Bowring asked him in a letter some
years later.&nbsp; He was never within some thousands of miles of
Kiachta.&nbsp; In 1826 he probably did go tramping through part
of Europe, but he did not reach the East, as some confused
references in the books suggest.&nbsp; The tale of Murtagh in
&ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; may incorporate some of his
adventures.&nbsp; At any rate, that alluring narrative was
certainly not given to Borrow in the year 1825 at Horncastle
Fair.&nbsp; There is clear evidence of that in the fact that a
portion of it was picked up nearly thirty years later in very
different circumstances.</p>
<p>The real itinerary of the tour of 1826 is probably by way of
Paris on foot to Bayonne; across the Pyrenees into Spain;
Pamplona, the Riviera, Italy, <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Genoa, and thence home by ship.&nbsp;
Slight traces can be found of such a journey.&nbsp; There is the
lightly-touched meeting with Vidocq in Paris.&nbsp; That
delectable rascal&rsquo;s career always had a strong fascination
for Borrow, whose appetite for picturesque blackguards was
greedy.&nbsp; Vidocq at this time was fifty years of age.&nbsp; A
quarter of a century of adventure as a showman, a soldier, a
galley-slave, and a highwayman had terminated in 1812 with his
appointment to the head of a detective office in Paris, on the
principle of setting a thief to catch a thief.&nbsp; By the year
1825 the authorities were persuaded that the principle was
unworkable, and dismissal ended Vidocq&rsquo;s career of
corruption and swindling.&nbsp; If Borrow met him in Paris the
next year, therefore, he found his hero a free lance.&nbsp; The
<i>M&eacute;moires</i> of M. Vidocq, which appeared in 1828, and
are probably at least as trustworthy as Baron Munchausen, were
among Borrow&rsquo;s favourite reading; his relish for
literature, embloomed with the flowers of crime and perfumed by
the breath of criminals, had been cultivated by the compilation
of the &ldquo;Celebrated Trials,&rdquo; and it never left
him.&nbsp; Vidocq and Peyrecourt loom large in passages of his
works; whether they made so great a figure in his actual
experiences in France is another question.&nbsp; He appears to
have met Baron Taylor at Bayonne, and naturally found in the
&ldquo;picturesque and romantic&rdquo; voyager a congenial
companion.&nbsp; From these lofty associations the <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>descent on
the other side of the Pyrenees to Quesada <a
name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72"
class="citation">[72]</a> and his &ldquo;Army of Faith,&rdquo;
the gang of frontiersmen who were helping themselves freely in
the name of the Church, was sudden and severe.&nbsp; But Borrow
seems to have fallen even further, for there is a dim suggestion
of his imprisonment at Pamplona, of his emergence from gaol in a
state of beggary, and his succour at the hands of a party of
gypsies whose patteran he followed in the mountains.&nbsp; He
tramped eastwards, ultimately brought up at Genoa, penniless, and
was assisted by some person or persons unknown to get ship for
England.</p>
<p>This is as far as Dr. Knapp has been able to trace the elusory
course of the Wandering Jew of Literature.&nbsp; The theory that
he acted as the travelling commissioner of a London newspaper
finds no support.&nbsp; By 1827 he was back in Norwich, keeping
his mother&rsquo;s small household accounts, visiting the
Tombland Fair to inspect &ldquo;Marshland Shales,&rdquo; the
glorious chieftain of all the equine race, grubbing for
booksellers, writing articles for newspapers.&nbsp; It was a mean
and anxious way of life, abominable to Borrow, who hated poverty
and was ashamed of it.&nbsp; Therein may be sought the real
reason why he &ldquo;veiled&rdquo; these years of his life.&nbsp;
His next appearance <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>in the literary arena is in the distinguished company of
Dr. John Bowring.</p>
<p>The Bowring episode in Borrow&rsquo;s life is one of its most
remarkable and least explicable features.&nbsp; Bowring seems to
have been a good friend to Borrow for many years, to have engaged
with him in literary collaboration, and to have exerted himself
in various directions on his behalf.&nbsp; His reward, so far as
Borrow&rsquo;s works go, is a scurrilous sketch of himself in
&ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; a long denunciation in the Appendix to
&ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; and the bitter hatred of a man who
knew how to hate as fiercely as he could love intensely.&nbsp;
The whole story of their severance is obscure, but there can be
little doubt that Borrow was entirely in the wrong, that the
charges he made against Bowring of treachery and falsehood were
baseless, and that of many people pilloried in Borrow&rsquo;s
books Bowring was among the least deserving such scurvy
treatment.&nbsp; We have observed already the circumstances of
the first meeting between Borrow and Bowring at Taylor&rsquo;s
house in Norwich.&nbsp; We shall see that Bowring came to his
rescue when he was in the sorest straits, and was, in fact, doing
much to help him during part of the &ldquo;veiled
period.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been the writer&rsquo;s fortune to secure <a
name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73"
class="citation">[73]</a> a series <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>of letters from Borrow to Bowring,
which throw much light upon his schemes and modes of life in the
last three of those mysterious years between his return from the
Continent and his engagement by the Bible Society.&nbsp; He did
not remain long in Norwich.&nbsp; In 1829 he was in London,
residing at No. 17, Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury, and deeply
employed about certain translations of Scandinavian poetry which
were to form the basis of a new book on more elaborate lines than
those of the &ldquo;Romantic Ballads.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bowring and
Borrow had a plan for issuing in collaboration a collection of
English versions, with interpretations, of those Northern poets
whom a purblind public, not yet obsessed by the Scandinavian
spirit in poetry and music, resolutely disregarded and
despised.&nbsp; This was the &ldquo;literary project&rdquo; of
which the world heard so much in the Appendix.&nbsp; The
arrangements went so far that a prospectus of the work was put
out.&nbsp; The title proposed was &ldquo;The Songs of
Scandinavia,&rdquo; and the collection was to be published in two
volumes octavo.&nbsp; The project remained a project, and the
niche left by expectant librarians for the two octavo volumes was
never filled.&nbsp; But in connection with the negotiations and
arrangements between Borrow and Bowring a correspondence occurred
which is full of interest and contains one or two characteristic
bits of Borrovian humour.&nbsp; Incidentally, the letters, if
taken in sequence, and read together with another one of the year
1842, show that, <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>up to a time not far ante-dating the publication of
&ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; with its gross attack on Bowring,
the two men were on the best possible terms.&nbsp; Indeed, in
1842 Borrow speaks of his old collaborator as &ldquo;my oldest, I
may say my only, friend.&rdquo; <a name="citation75"></a><a
href="#footnote75" class="citation">[75]</a></p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>It were
greatly to be wished that the sordid dispute with Bowring might
be numbered among the delenda of Borrow&rsquo;s history, but some
mention of it will be necessary.&nbsp; Unhappily, no satisfactory
explanation can be given which is at all flattering to
Borrow.&nbsp; For these letters prove conclusively that he
introduced into &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and its sequel opinions
about Bowring which he certainly did not hold at the time of
which he was writing.</p>
<p>In 1829 their Scandinavian scheme was in the tideway.&nbsp;
They had written and they had met for the discussion of their
plans; Borrow had done a great deal of translation.&nbsp; He was
exceedingly anxious that at any rate the first volume should
appear at once; for, as he said in a letter written on the last
day of the year, he was &ldquo;<i>terribly afraid of being
forestalled in the Kiampe Viser by some of those Scotch
blackguards</i>, who affect to translate from all languages, of
which they are fully as ignorant as Lockhart is of
Spanish.&rdquo;&nbsp; The italicised passage is underlined in
Borrow&rsquo;s letter; it is a curious foretaste of some of the
choicer invective which he afterwards bestowed on Scott and the
Scots, and of his disagreement with Lockhart.&nbsp; The
preparations were hurried on with a view to the appearance of the
first part of the book in February.&nbsp; The drafting of the
prospectus was left to Borrow, and on January 8th (1830) he sent
a copy to Bowring for his inspection, inviting &ldquo;the
correction of your master-hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had, he said,
&ldquo;endeavoured <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>to frame a Danish style,&rdquo; but was not sure whether
he had succeeded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alter, I pray you,&rdquo; he
exclaimed, &ldquo;whatever false logic has crept into it, find a
remedy for its incoherencies, and render it fit for its intended
purpose.&rdquo;&nbsp; There follows a delightful touch of
egotism.&nbsp; He has, he explains, had a rising headache for two
days, which has &ldquo;almost&rdquo; prevented him from doing
anything.&nbsp; But, he adds with fine nonchalance, &ldquo;I sat
down this morning and translated a hundred lines of the
&lsquo;May Day&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;as though a hundred lines of
English verse were a trifle which he threw off without effort,
<i>malgr&eacute;</i> his &ldquo;rising headache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bowring examined the prospectus, made what revisions he
thought necessary, and sent it back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I approve of the prospectus in every respect,&rdquo;
wrote Borrow (January 14th).&nbsp; &ldquo;It is businesslike, and
there is nothing flashy in it.&nbsp; I do not wish to suggest one
alteration.&rdquo;&nbsp; He goes on to describe the energy with
which he is working, and speaks of having rendered four hundred
lines in one day!&nbsp; The last paragraph of this letter
displays Borrow in a different attitude towards reviews and
reviewing from that which he adopted in after years.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When you see the foreign editor,&rdquo; he tells
Bowring,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I should feel much obliged if you would
speak to him about my reviewing Tegn&eacute;r, and inquire
whether a <i>good</i> article on Welsh poetry would be
received.&nbsp; I have the advantage of not being a
Welshman.&nbsp; I would speak the truth, and would give
translations from some of the best <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>Welsh poetry; and I really believe
that my translations would not be the worst that have been made
from the Welsh tongue.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this condition of things, in which the romantic ferment
caused by Steffens and Oehlenschl&auml;ger in Denmark was to be
reproduced in England by Borrow&rsquo;s translations, did not
last long.&nbsp; Difficulties arose in connection with the
publication of the proposed book, and the enthusiasm paled as the
year progressed.&nbsp; The two volumes receded from view; the
twin mountain in labour finally brought forth a review article of
some forty pages.&nbsp; This was despatched in the summer to the
<i>Foreign Quarterly Review</i>, was held back for twelve months,
and appeared at last in the number for June, 1831.&nbsp; In this
Bowring wrote in lively style on Danish and Norwegian literature,
and Borrow supplied sixteen specimens of verse.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Bowring was doing what he could to assist his
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> to some profitable employment.&nbsp;
He sent him an ancient manuscript which Grundtvig, the Danish
poet, wanted to have transcribed.&nbsp; Borrow said (June 7th)
the task would not be overpaid at &pound;49, but as he was
&ldquo;doing nothing particular&rdquo; at the time, and might
learn something from it, he would do it for &pound;20.&nbsp;
Bowring also exerted his influence to get him work in the
magazines.&nbsp; During the summer of 1830, Borrow flitted from
Great Russell Street to No. 7, Museum Street, <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>and in the
autumn, went to Norwich for a holiday.&nbsp; In the letter
(September 14th) in which he tells Bowring of his proposal to
leave London for Norwich, we get the first hint of a project
which now and then flashed through his mind for a year or
two&mdash;that of entering the military service: &ldquo;I have
thought of attempting to get into the French service, as I should
like prodigiously to serve under Clausel in the next Bedouin
campaign.&rdquo;&nbsp; This remained a thought, though, as we
shall see, other plans of the same character went a little
further.&nbsp; In the same letter he complained that he was very
unwell, but traced his malady to ennui and unsettled prospects,
and hoped that cold bathing in October and November would prove
of some service to him.&nbsp; There is no reference in this
correspondence to one task which he himself asserts he achieved
in 1830.&nbsp; That was the translation of Elis Wyn.&nbsp; At the
instance of &ldquo;a little bookseller of my acquaintance&rdquo;
in Smithfield, he rendered from the Welsh Wyn&rsquo;s,
&ldquo;Visions of the Sleeping Bard.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the
nearest approach he made to the promise of literary success; but
even here his malign fate dogged him.&nbsp; When the little
bookseller saw the translation, he begged off the bargain on the
plea that &ldquo;the terrible descriptions of vice and torment
would frighten the genteel part of the English public out of
their wits. . . . Myn Diawl!&nbsp; I had no idea till I read him
in English that Elis Wyn had been such a terrible <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>fellow!&rdquo;&nbsp; The sly dig at the
&ldquo;genteel&rdquo; public may be reasonably attributed to the
bookmaker rather than to the bookseller.</p>
<p>Before he departed from London, Borrow, returning some books
to Bowring, utters (September 17th) one of those ejaculations on
public affairs which he subsequently inserted as tags to many of
his letters: &ldquo;More Revolutions, I see.&nbsp; The King of
Saxony has run away, and the Kent peasantry are burning stacks
and houses.&nbsp; <i>Where will all this end</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dozen plans for carving a way to undying fame and modest
fortune, all equally futile, were built up and fell down about
this time.&nbsp; Apparently Borrow could not rid himself of the
delusion that a hungry world was waiting to devour the beauties
of the Gaelic Bards, if only they were served up in a suitable
form for general consumption.&nbsp; He launched at the devoted
heads of the Highland Society of London a scheme under which the
Society was to employ (and pay) him for two years in translating
the Gaelic Bards into English verse.&nbsp; The scheme left the
Highland Society as cold as the Bards would have left the reading
world.&nbsp; He turned his artillery upon the British
Museum.&nbsp; The Codex Exoniensis was to be copied; he applied
for the work, but without success.&nbsp; It was done in 1831 by
one of the regular officials of the Museum.&nbsp; Discouraged but
not dismayed, he sought other employment in Bloomsbury, and asked
Bowring to put in a word for him.&nbsp; The Doctor <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>pointed out
that in his position it was necessary to go about such a matter
with discretion.&nbsp; It would not do for him to originate an
application, but if the authorities of the Museum could be
induced to seek his opinion, he would give Borrow such a
character as would &ldquo;take you to the top of Hecla
itself.&nbsp; You have claims, strong ones, and I should rejoice
to see you niched in the British Museum.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this
design failed like the rest.&nbsp; In a letter to Bowring he
described himself, with melancholy eloquence, as &ldquo;drifting
upon the sea of the world, and likely to be so.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
Borrow there was &ldquo;no fiercer hell than failure&rdquo;; but
the inferno was of his own creation.&nbsp; His greatest failure
was the failure to realise that there was no sort of demand for
the work he insisted on doing, and that its intrinsic value was
far below the standard at which he placed it.</p>
<p>Compelled thus to abandon his literary ambitions for the
present, he turned his efforts in another direction.&nbsp; He
began the pursuit of a shimmering phantom over which, in the
course of his life, he contrived to waste a great deal of
valuable time.&nbsp; Upon what he based the idea does not appear,
but Borrow seems to have imagined that he had some claim to
official employment abroad.&nbsp; It did not much matter whether
the work was made for him by the British Government or by a
foreign State, so long as he should be given the opportunity of
displaying his philological prowess in foreign parts.&nbsp; After
the <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>appearance of the joint article in the <i>Foreign
Quarterly</i>, as Bowring seemed to be able to do nothing for him
at the British Museum, Borrow asked him to see what he could do
towards getting him a post under the Belgian Government.&nbsp;
Bowring made the application, but without success; the Belgians
were not at the moment in need of any English assistance, however
talented.&nbsp; Borrow keenly recognised his friend&rsquo;s
diligence in the matter, and turned his heaviest artillery on the
Ministry at Brussels, who were so obstinately blind to the
advantages of having Mr. George Borrow in their service.&nbsp;
They did not seem, he said in a letter to Bowring written from
Willow Lane, Norwich, and dated September 11th, 1831, either to
know or to care for the opinion of the great Cyrus, whose advice
to his captains he quoted from Xenophon: &ldquo;Take no heed from
what countries ye fill up your ranks, but seek recruits as ye do
horses, not those particularly who are of your own country, but
those of merit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Belgium, having failed to appreciate
the worth of George Borrow, at once became the most contemptible
nation on earth:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Belgians will only have such recruits
as are born in Belgium, and when we consider the <i>heroic</i>
manner in which the native Belgian army defended the person of
their new sovereign in the last conflict with the Dutch, can we
blame them for their determination?&nbsp; It is rather singular,
however, that, resolved as they are to be served only by
themselves, they should have sent for 50,000 Frenchmen to clear
their country of a handful of Hollanders, who have generally been
considered the most unwarlike people in <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>Europe, and
who, if they had had fair play given them, would long ere this
time have replanted the Orange flag on the towers of Brussels and
made the Belgians what they deserved to be&mdash;hewers of wood
and drawers of water.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sardonic outburst is one of the earliest samples of the
polemical style which Borrow was to develop so strongly in later
years.</p>
<p>As he could neither go to fight Bedouins under Clausel nor
enter the Belgian service in Europe, it appears to have occurred
to his friend Bowring that he might care to follow in his
father&rsquo;s footsteps, and that the British service might suit
him at a pinch.&nbsp; If Borrow would like to purchase a
commission, Bowring offered to introduce his name to the War
Secretary.&nbsp; Borrow replied that his name had been down for
several years for the purchase of a commission, but he had never
had sufficient interest to procure an appointment.&nbsp; He would
not now mind serving in the militia if they were to be embodied
for service in Ireland (&ldquo;that unhappy country&rdquo;), but
he wished to leave the question open for a few months in order to
see whether something more promising turned up.&nbsp; If he had
not secured employment within two or three months, he would then
ask Bowring to redeem his promise in the matter of the War
Secretary, and to recommend him to a corps in one of the Eastern
colonies on the plea that he was &ldquo;well grounded in
Arabic&rdquo; and had some talent for languages:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>&ldquo;I flatter myself that I could do a great deal in
the East, provided I could once get there, either in a civil or
military capacity.&nbsp; There is much talk at present about
translating European books in the two great languages, the Arabic
and Persian.&nbsp; Now, I believe that with my enthusiasm for
these tongues I could, if resident in the East, become in a year
or two better acquainted with them than any European has been
yet, and more capable of executing such a task. . . .&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter concluded with a postscript in which he requested
that his best remembrances might be presented to Mrs. Bowring and
to Edgar, their son; and, he added, &ldquo;tell them they will
both be starved.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is now a report in the street that
twelve corn-stacks are blazing within twenty miles of this
place.&nbsp; I have lately been wandering about Norfolk, and I am
sorry to say that the minds of the peasantry are in a horrible
state of excitement.&nbsp; I have repeatedly heard men and women
in the harvest-field swear that not a grain of the corn they were
cutting should be eaten, and that they would as lieve be hanged
as live.&nbsp; I am afraid all this will end in a famine and a
rustic war.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reform staved off the &ldquo;rustic war,&rdquo; and other
things intervened to prevent Borrow from carrying out his
half-formed intention of becoming a military man.</p>

85</span>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="GutSmall">IN FOREIGN PARTS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Romance</span> brought up&rdquo;
the year 1832.&nbsp; It was a year full of events with an
important bearing on the course of Borrow&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; In
the first place, he became acquainted with the Skeppers, of
Oulton Hall, near Lowestoft.&nbsp; The introduction to this
family issued in a friendship with Mr. Skepper&rsquo;s sister,
the widow of a young naval officer named Clarke.&nbsp; In Mrs.
Clarke, a woman somewhat older than himself&mdash;she was
thirty-six and he was twenty-nine&mdash;he met the woman who was
to bring into his life its fairest influence and its rarest
happiness.&nbsp; But the story of this romance must be postponed
for a few pages in order to the relation of a sequence of affairs
without which it cannot be understood.&nbsp; They resulted from
sundry conversations about Borrow&mdash;between the Skeppers and
the Rev. Francis Cunningham, Rector of Pakefield, and in turn
between Cunningham and Joseph Gurney, his brother-in-law, from
whose meadows at Earlham George had fished in boyhood.</p>
<p>Both Cunningham and Gurney were interested in the work of the
Bible Society, and between them the idea was hatched of employing
Borrow&rsquo;s philological <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>learning in its behalf.&nbsp; The
Society happened at the moment to be looking for a man to
superintend the printing of the New Testament in Manchu.&nbsp;
There were many negotiations, and ultimately the engagement was
consummated which made Borrow&rsquo;s modest fortune.</p>
<p>To go to St. Petersburg on this business of the Bible
Society&rsquo;s was an adventure after Borrow&rsquo;s own
heart.&nbsp; He had passed through some exceedingly stormy
waters, and in this employment he found a secure and congenial
harbour.&nbsp; He could well afford to regard lightly the
critical attitude of certain people in Norwich, who did not
forget to recall the episode of &ldquo;godless Billy
Taylor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their temper was reflected in the letter of
Harriet Martineau referring to Borrow as a &ldquo;polyglot
gentleman,&rdquo; and remarking that his appearance as &ldquo;a
devout agent of the Bible Society&rdquo; evoked &ldquo;one shout
of laughter from all who remembered the old Norwich
days.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow did not like their laughter, and he did
not forgive their contempt.&nbsp; But for the time he was too
busy with the actualities of his new situation to trouble about
them, and too elated with his suddenly brightened prospects to be
cast down by the jeers of the scornful.</p>
<p>He was going a journey into a far country, and he was going on
a more or less philological errand.&nbsp; His task was to
undertake the production in the Russian capital of the Manchu
version of the Sacred <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>Books made by Lipotsof.&nbsp; Invited
to London to see the officials of the Society, he set off in high
spirits&mdash;and on foot.&nbsp; The long road stretched for a
hundred and twelve miles between Norwich and London&mdash;that
road which some ten years before he had travelled by coach with
the little green box of poetical translations.&nbsp; He now
tramped it in 27&frac12; hours, and his expenses <i>en route</i>
amounted to fivepence halfpenny!&nbsp; This feat was one of his
favourite boasts.&nbsp; It was, in its way, a remarkable
achievement.&nbsp; Few big, healthy young men would care to
undertake such long-sustained exertion on a pint of ale, half a
pint of milk, a roll of bread, and two apples.&nbsp; But such is
Borrow&rsquo;s tale of his commissariat arrangements on this
expedition.</p>
<p>The Society desired him to learn the Manchu language before he
set out for Russia.&nbsp; They gave him six months for the
purpose.&nbsp; Even for a meteoric philologist like Borrow, who
swallowed a language by memorising its dictionary, six months
meant short commons.&nbsp; He could not possibly acquire more
than a nodding acquaintance with that most difficult of the
tongues of Babel.&nbsp; However, he set about his task with
zeal.</p>
<p>There is one amusing passage in the correspondence between him
and the Secretary of the Bible Society.&nbsp; Observe the true
Borrovian spirit asserting itself in the letter where he
expresses pleasure at the prospect of &ldquo;becoming useful to
the Deity, to man, <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>and to myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Observe the solemn
admonition of the good secretary, when he perceived that a sense
of human frailty was not one of Borrow&rsquo;s most striking
characteristics: &ldquo;Doubtless you mean the prospect of
glorifying God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereafter, the Borrovian spirit was
subdued (in correspondence) to the proper standard of
orthodoxy.</p>
<p>At the end of June, 1833, he set sail for St. Petersburg, by
way of Hamburg, and was highly delighted with the Russian
capital.&nbsp; He made his way into the acquaintanceship of a
number of literary people, in whose society he found congenial
entertainment.&nbsp; Among them he speedily established for
himself quite a reputation.&nbsp; It was here that he began his
long friendship with Hasfeldt, which produced a prolific
correspondence.&nbsp; Hasfeldt was a Dane attached to the Russian
Government, and a linguist of attainments, who added to his
income by the teaching of European languages.&nbsp; He conceived
a remarkable fondness for &ldquo;tall George,&rdquo; as he called
him; the affection was returned as fully as Borrow could return a
friendship, and that was in much higher measure than many
estimates of him suggest.&nbsp; He met Russian scholars, and
found many opportunities for extending his philological studies
in the direction of the Oriental languages.</p>
<p>His work on the Chinese version was hard and long.&nbsp; He
had to use German printers, who did not always feel for the task
the enthusiasm which Borrow <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>expected everybody to throw into
anything in which he himself was concerned.&nbsp; They had to be
bribed with vodka, and other things, in order that progress might
be secured.&nbsp; The Bible Society presumably swallowed the
vodka in their delight at the energy Borrow displayed, and they
passed a resolution to pay him any expenses to which he might be
put in the execution of the commission.&nbsp; He had to furbish
up an old fount of type in the Chinese character, that had been
lying rusting in a cellar for many years, and to get everything
in order himself, because, of course, it was impossible to obtain
compositors who knew anything of the Manchu.&nbsp; He even turned
printer.&nbsp; So keen was the zest with which he entered into
the work that he submitted a proposal to the Society to undertake
the distribution of the books when they were printed, going
overland to China, and looking in upon the Tartars on the
way!&nbsp; Without doubt he would have done it but for the fact
that the Russian Government refused to grant him a passport for
the purpose.&nbsp; It is characteristic of Borrow that years
afterwards he said, and doubtless thought, that he had been
overland to China.</p>
<p>The work of printing done, he paid a hurried visit to Moscow,
gathering impressions for the description of the Kremlin to be
found in &ldquo;The Bible in Spain,&rdquo; and on September 9th,
1835, he left St. Petersburg for England, having spent the
previous night in a solemn leave-taking of Hasfeldt.&nbsp; While
in St. <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>Petersburg hard at work, and feeling run down, he had
&ldquo;the Horrors&rdquo; several times, but affected to have
found a cure for it in the shape of strong port wine.&nbsp; It
was during his stay in Russia that the news arrived of the death
of his brother John in Mexico.&nbsp; He had discovered other
activities to occupy him besides the translation of the Testament
into Chinese.&nbsp; He turned homilies of the Church of England
into Russian and Manchu, and did translations of some of the
sacred Buddhist books from Manchu into English.&nbsp; He
conceived at the moment no high opinion of the Buddhist
philosophy.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will be surprised,&rdquo; he writes
to the Rev. F. Cunningham, &ldquo;that Satan by such inconsistent
trash should have been able to ensnare the souls of
millions!&rdquo;&nbsp; If that had been read in the Martineau
household there might have been another &ldquo;burst of
laughter.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was while he was in St. Petersburg,
too, that he published his &ldquo;Targum,&rdquo; a collection of
poetic translations from thirty different languages and
dialects.&nbsp; When Pushkin, the poet, after Borrow&rsquo;s
departure, received a presentation copy of this book, he
expressed his great regret that he had not met the author.</p>
<p>Borrow reached London on the 18th September, and went down to
Norfolk, feeling anxious again about his future, and hoping that
the Bible Society would be able to find some further employment
for him.&nbsp; He was not disappointed.&nbsp; The Society had not
yet given up hope that they might find a way to <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>send him to
China, but in the meantime they resolved to commission him to
Portugal.&nbsp; On November 2nd they passed a resolution that he
should be asked to go to Lisbon and Oporto to inquire about
&ldquo;means and channels for promoting the circulation of the
Holy Scriptures in Portugal.&rdquo; <a name="citation91"></a><a
href="#footnote91" class="citation">[91]</a>&nbsp; Here is the
origin of two of his books, of which one was &ldquo;The Bible in
Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; On November 6th he sailed from London,
touching at Falmouth on the 8th, and was at Lisbon on the
13th.&nbsp; He was to confer with one Wilby about the work; but,
Wilby being away, Borrow consoled himself with the company of
Captain Heyland, of the 35th Foot, whose acquaintance he had made
on the voyage.&nbsp; With him he made several trips, <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>upon one of
which he met the <i>boh&eacute;mienne</i> landlady of
Cintra.&nbsp; During this first expedition to the Peninsula, he
set up relations with the gypsies of Spain, which provided the
germ of the first of his books that attracted anything like
general attention.&nbsp; At Badajoz he encountered a gypsy tribe,
by whom he was detained ten days.&nbsp; In that time he had
translated the Gospel of Saint Luke into the C&acirc;lo, or
Spanish gypsy language, and the version was subsequently printed
by the Bible Society.&nbsp; One of the Romany chals, Antonio
Lopez, accompanied him most of the way to Madrid, delaying three
days at Merida in a gypsy house.&nbsp; Antonio finally went off
with a gitana.&nbsp; Borrow bought a donkey from the girl, and
rode on the animal&rsquo;s back as far as Talavera, where he sold
it to a Toledo Jew whom he met on the road.&nbsp; The rest of the
journey to Madrid he did by the diligence, like a common
Christian.</p>
<p>By the time of his arrival there, he had formed a definite
project of printing the New Testament in Spanish and in Spain,
without comment or note of any sort.&nbsp; The law would prohibit
the circulation of such a book if it were printed outside and
brought into the country.&nbsp; It was decided to use the current
Catholic version, in order not to excite any more prejudices than
could be helped, and to sell cheaply, and thus to spread the book
among people who had never seen it before.&nbsp; This was a time
in Spain of constant political excitement, chronic Ministerial <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>change, and
periodical revolution; and Borrow had much trouble in getting
official recognition for the enterprise, without which he might
as well have left it alone.&nbsp; But the way was smoothed for
him by Sir George Villiers, the British Minister, and at the end
of twelve months he returned to England with an active campaign
mapped out in his mind, for which he soon obtained the approval
of the Society.&nbsp; In a letter to his mother about this, he
remarked that his &ldquo;ordination&rdquo; would be put off till
his return.&nbsp; This is the first and the last that we hear of
any proposal to enter the Church.</p>
<p>On his way out to Spain the second time, he happened across
Santa Coloma, the Carlist, who is frequently met with hereafter
in his Spanish adventures.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo;
relates very closely the events of the next two years&mdash;his
wanderings and escapes, his enterprise in Madrid, where he set up
a bookselling shop, his imprisonment for insulting the Government
and the Catholic Church&mdash;an offence of which he was quite
innocent, for such was not his method at the time.&nbsp; The
trouble was brought on him by an evangelical firebrand, named
Lieutenant Graydon, who led Borrow into one of his scrapes with
the Peninsular powers by claiming to be associated with him in
the work of the Bible Society.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s imprisonment
resulted in a declaration by him in the Spanish Press, directed
against Graydon.&nbsp; He said that neither himself nor the Bible
Society was <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>actuated by any enmity against either the Government or
the Catholic clergy of Spain, and concluded by avowing himself
the sole agent of the Society in the Peninsula.&nbsp; Out of this
grew an estrangement between Borrow and the Society.&nbsp; It
happened that Graydon was one of the pets of Mr. Brandram, joint
secretary of the Society, and was actually regarded as one of
their agents, though he received no pay, being the holder of a
Government pension.&nbsp; He was an enthusiastic evangelist, who
seems to have lacked nothing save discretion, but manifested this
defect by fierce attacks upon the Catholic faith in its
stronghold, instead of contenting himself with prosecuting the
primary work of the Society, which was the distribution of the
unadulterated Scriptures.&nbsp; In the event, Graydon was
withdrawn from Spain, but it was expressly stated that this step
was taken only in the interests of his own safety, and that the
Society would pass no judgment on the merits of the dispute
between him and Borrow until Graydon had returned to England and
had an opportunity of vindicating himself.&nbsp; Borrow at the
same time was ordered to cease issuing his advertisement.&nbsp;
It is difficult to judge a man like Graydon.&nbsp; His good faith
in all he did can hardly be doubted, but there is no question
that the result of his ill-timed action was to put an end to the
work of the Society and the circulation of the Bible in Spain for
many years.</p>
<p>The relations between Earl Street and Borrow <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>grew more
strained, and very soon he had practically a command to come to
London.&nbsp; He packed up and returned, but such was the force
of his character that he fascinated Earl Street into sending him
to Spain a third time.&nbsp; He was only home a month or two, and
got back to the Peninsula on the last day of 1838.&nbsp; But the
mission was not of much further use, for there had been another
change of Ministry in the meanwhile, and Borrow and the Society
were again out of official favour.</p>
<p>He proceeded to Seville, settling there for a purpose, as we
shall presently see.&nbsp; In the sunlit southern city he was
encountered by an English traveller, who has left a most
entertaining account of him.&nbsp; This was Lieutenant-Colonel
Elers Napier, in whose &ldquo;Excursions along the Shores of the
Mediterranean&rdquo; appears the remarkable figure of a Man of
Mystery, who is easily identified as Don Jorge&mdash;though
apparently Napier never learned who he was.&nbsp; Borrow, six
feet three, with piercing black eyes, snowy head, and swarthy,
hairless face, made a profound impression on his new
friend&mdash;and we may be sure that he omitted nothing that
would deepen it.&nbsp; He showed off all his best points and
maintained a rigid silence upon the question of his identity, so
that in Napier&rsquo;s recollections he assumes almost
supernatural proportions, and is described throughout as
&ldquo;The Unknown.&rdquo;&nbsp; He revealed all his
miscellaneous acquaintance with languages, Occidental and
Oriental.&nbsp; He <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>conversed with the Colonel in Spanish, in Latin, in
French (&ldquo;the purest Parisian accent&rdquo;), in
Italian.&nbsp; He spoke English perfectly, but did not appear to
be an Englishman.&nbsp; He was even as conversant with Hindu as
the Anglo-Indian himself; he seemed, Napier says, to know
everything and everybody, but was apparently known to nobody
himself.&nbsp; His almost magic power over the gypsies, his
familiarity with their patois and their customs, the way in which
they almost worshipped him when he took Napier by night for a
visit to one of their weird encampments, added to the marvel.</p>
<p>But the real significance of the visit to Seville is not to be
sought in the archives of the Bible Society or in the jottings of
Colonel Napier.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s friendship with Mrs. Clarke,
of Oulton, arose in the fashion already mentioned.&nbsp; His long
absences from England did not impair it, and in 1838 it developed
in peculiar circumstances, which were the subject from time to
time of scandal utterly unfounded, and of gossip more or less
impertinent and irrelevant.&nbsp; Whether Borrow, during the
years from 1832 to 1838 nurtured dreams of any relation closer
than friendship it is hardly possible to determine.&nbsp; He was
not &ldquo;a marrying man,&rdquo; and probably the sober little
romance that ended in their wedding was a thing of sudden
growth.&nbsp; That theory is encouraged by a passage in his
correspondence as late as 1838, when he told his friend
Us&oacute;z that it was better to suffer the <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>halter than
the yoke, and expressed his conviction that bachelordom was the
better kingdom for him.&nbsp; But at the end of the same year,
during his stay in England, he visited his friends at Oulton, and
found a state of affairs that doubtless altered his judgment.</p>
<p>The business of Mrs. Clarke, who was the principal heiress of
the Oulton Hall estate, was in a highly complicated
condition.&nbsp; She had none but professional advisers, save
Borrow, and leant with obvious relief upon his friendship to
guide her through a puzzling maze of family disputes.&nbsp; It
would be wearisome to attempt to follow the controversies about
the disposition of the property.&nbsp; They finally involved
Chancery proceedings, and Dr. Knapp asserts that Mrs.
Clarke&rsquo;s solicitors advised her that it would be well for
her to disappear for a time.&nbsp; The reason for this counsel is
obscure, but the fact that it was followed is important.&nbsp;
Mrs. Clarke consulted Borrow about it, with the result that her
evanishment took the form of a journey to Spain, accompanied by
her daughter Henrietta.&nbsp; The fact created an amazing
quantity of idle speculation and not too generous
suggestion.&nbsp; The plan was arranged in March, 1839.&nbsp;
Borrow was then in Madrid, and immediately posted off to Seville
to prepare a house for the reception of the two ladies, having
given them some useful hints, drawn from his long experience of
Spain, as to the household gods they ought to bring with
them.&nbsp; <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>They arrived in June, and were installed at No. 7,
Plazuela de la Pila Seca, which Borrow had modestly furnished and
was himself occupying.</p>
<p>The little wind of scandal that played about this arrangement
will not disturb the equanimity of those who know their
Borrow.&nbsp; The <i>m&eacute;nage</i> was unquestionably a
little difficult to explain to the Spaniards to whom explanation
was necessary, and to this difficulty Dr. Knapp attributes
Borrow&rsquo;s expedition to Tangier at the end of August.&nbsp;
This was the trip with which &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo;
suddenly closed down in the approved Borrovian style.&nbsp; The
scandal was of short duration and small effect.&nbsp; But in
after years other suggestions were made, including the highly
improbable and offensive one that Mrs. Clarke was at this time
pursuing Borrow with the object of matrimony, and
&ldquo;travelled over half Europe in search of him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Another friendly theory advanced was that Borrow&rsquo;s
proceedings were governed by mercenary motives, and that he
married Mrs. Clarke because she had an income of three or four
hundred a year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the quarrel with the Bible Society was dragging its
slow length along.&nbsp; The correspondence is confused and in
general uninteresting, except that it shows how Borrow&rsquo;s
attitude towards Earl Street had altered since the time when he
climbed down before the protests of the good secretary in the
first days of their association.&nbsp; He was on his feet
now.</p>
<p><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>He felt
surer of his ground than when he was at his wits&rsquo; end for
employment and subsistence.&nbsp; Consequently his native
impatience of restraint came out.&nbsp; The Bible Society never
gauged their man.&nbsp; In one despatch to Earl Street, Borrow
had said of a certain enterprise that &ldquo;his usual good
fortune accompanied them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Brandram, &ldquo;is a mode of speaking to which we
are not well accustomed; it savours, some of our friends would
say, a little of the profane. . . . Pious expressions may be
thrust into letters <i>ad nauseam</i>, and it is not for that I
plead; but is there not a <i>via media</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
breach grew wider and severance was ordained; it was consummated
very shortly after Borrow&rsquo;s return to England at the
beginning of the next year.</p>
<p>The visit to Tangier occupied some five or six weeks.&nbsp;
Borrow returned to Seville at the end of September, and set to
work compiling notes and making transcripts for his book on the
Gypsies of Spain.&nbsp; The enterprise was assisted by diligent
friends, such as Bailly, <a name="citation99a"></a><a
href="#footnote99a" class="citation">[99a]</a> Us&oacute;z, <a
name="citation99b"></a><a href="#footnote99b"
class="citation">[99b]</a> and Gayangos. <a
name="citation99c"></a><a href="#footnote99c"
class="citation">[99c]</a>&nbsp; The fruits of their curious
researches among dusty and neglected bookshelves may be seen in
the long translations from archaic Spanish authors in &ldquo;The
<a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>Zincali.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a Spaniard who invented
the epigram on the virtues of old wood to burn, old wine to
drink, old friends to trust, and old books to read.&nbsp; But we
may be excused for excluding from the category of books which
have the bouquet of old crusted port the discourses of Dr. Sancho
de Moncada and others to which Borrow has treated us so
liberally.</p>
<p>He spared time from these labours and from the task of
settling up with the Bible Society to pay considerable attention
to Mrs. Clarke and &ldquo;Hen&rdquo;&mdash;the affectionate
diminutive given to her daughter Henrietta.&nbsp; The widow had
found Seville, as Borrow promised her it should be, &ldquo;a most
agreeable retreat,&rdquo; where &ldquo;the growls of her enemies
could scarcely reach her.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ladies enjoyed to the
full the startling change from the life of the English fens to
that of the sunny and many-hued Spanish city.&nbsp; They realised
his prophecy that it would be a delicious existence where,
&ldquo;during the summer and autumn, the people reside in their
courtyards, over which an awning is hung.&nbsp; A very delicious
existence it is&mdash;a species of dream of sunshine and shade,
of falling water and flowers.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, incidentally, of
course, a very fit setting for such love-making as came to be
done: the weather is always fine when people are courting, as a
modern sage has remarked.&nbsp; Not much more than a month after
his return from Morocco, Borrow had proposed marriage to Mrs.
Clarke, and <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>had been accepted.&nbsp; The arrangement was to a
certain extent a &ldquo;convenient&rdquo; one for both
parties.&nbsp; With little prospect of further employment by the
Bible Society, and only a precarious hold on any profitable
literary work, Borrow had no glowing future before him.&nbsp;
Mrs. Clarke felt the need of a man to manage affairs for her at
Oulton.&nbsp; Still, there is ample evidence that this was a
fortuitous concourse of circumstances, and that it had little to
do with the marriage.&nbsp; The warm English friendship had
become more intimate as the years passed, and there was nothing
more natural than this sequel when they were thrown together in
the &ldquo;delightful existence&rdquo; in which she hid from her
&ldquo;enemies&rdquo; at Seville.</p>
<p>Having decided to cross the Rubicon, Borrow determined that
the sooner it was done the better.&nbsp; There was to be no
&ldquo;sweet, reluctant, amorous delay.&rdquo;&nbsp; He began at
once to make preparations for the return to England in order that
they might be married in their own country.&nbsp; One of the
first steps to be taken to this end was to procure his passport
from the Alcalde.&nbsp; Why this official disapproved of Borrow
cannot be affirmed.&nbsp; As a son of the True Church he may have
conceived a prejudice against the Protestant colporteur; he may
have been infected by the &ldquo;spy&rdquo; mania; he may have
been merely anxious to display his own importance.&nbsp; At any
rate, he resolved to give the <i>Ingles rubio</i> as much trouble
as possible to remove himself and his party out of Spain.&nbsp;
He <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>raised questions about the validity of Borrow&rsquo;s
papers, refused the passport, and would not be pacified by the
offer of fees, &ldquo;lawful or unlawful,&rdquo; to quote Borrow,
who sent to him apparently under the impression that authority,
though a stubborn bear, might be led by the nose with gold, as
the clown said to Autolycus.&nbsp; When Don Jorge himself went to
the office to inquire into the matter, he was told to go
away.&nbsp; Instead he continued to investigate the motives of
the Alcalde, who thereupon threatened to carry him to
prison.&nbsp; Borrow dared him to do so&mdash;and he did
it.&nbsp; This was his third acquaintance with the inside of a
Spanish gaol.&nbsp; He sent a reassuring note to Mrs. Clarke, and
had a message taken to the British Consul.&nbsp; Colonel Napier
had noticed earlier in the year that the police kept sharp eyes
on Borrow, and attributed it to the suspicion that he was (of all
things in the world!) a Russian spy.&nbsp; There was clearly
something in the suggestion that he was under espionage, for
while he was in prison his house was searched for papers.&nbsp;
Nothing &ldquo;compromising&rdquo; being found, he was released
the next night.</p>
<p>His indignation at this outrage reached white heat, and did
not die down for months.&nbsp; His insistence upon redress
detained Borrow in the country much longer than he had proposed
to stop.&nbsp; Once having got his knife into Spanish
officialdom, he twisted it round till he had gouged out his pound
of flesh.&nbsp; And even then, after he had returned to England,
and the <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>knife was no longer available, Spanish officialdom
received very severe treatment from that even more terrible
weapon, his pen.&nbsp; From Seville he set working all the
diplomatic machinery that an injured Briton could influence; he
went to Madrid on the business; he wrote incessantly and
exhaustively about it.&nbsp; His return to England and his
marriage had to wait until he had settled accounts with the
impertinent Alcalde de Barrio, who had laid sacrilegious hands
upon a subject of her Britannic Majesty&mdash;and that subject
George Borrow.&nbsp; While ambassadors and consuls and State
secretaries were busily employed in official correspondence on
his behalf, he proceeded with the work on the
&ldquo;Gypsies,&rdquo; and did not get away from Spain till
April, 1840.</p>
<p>The embarkation of the colporteur and his party upon the
<i>Royal Adelaide</i> steamer at Cadiz was an impressive
ceremony.&nbsp; Borrow was taking a long farewell of Spain, and
he was not going home without souvenirs of his residence
there.&nbsp; In the previous year he had purchased the Arab horse
celebrated in his books as &ldquo;Sidi Habismilk&rdquo; (being
interpreted, &ldquo;My Lord Mustard&rdquo;).&nbsp; The retinue at
Cadiz included not only Mrs. Clarke and Henrietta, but also Sidi
Habismilk and Hayim ben Attar, &ldquo;the Jew of Fez,&rdquo;
Borrow&rsquo;s servant. <a name="citation103"></a><a
href="#footnote103" class="citation">[103]</a>&nbsp; They touched
at Lisbon, where General Cordova came on board&mdash;not on
business of State, but in search of a consignment of cigars that
<a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>had been
sent to him in the care of the captain.&nbsp; Borrow wrote an
amusing sketch of the General and two Secretaries of Legation
stowing Havana cigars in their pockets &ldquo;with all the
eagerness of contrabandista.&rdquo; <a name="citation104"></a><a
href="#footnote104" class="citation">[104]</a>&nbsp; The vessel
arrived in the port of London on April 16th, and the party put up
at the Spread Eagle, in Gracechurch Street.&nbsp; As soon as the
licence could be obtained, the marriage of &ldquo;George Henry
Borrow, bachelor,&rdquo; with &ldquo;Mary Clarke, widow,&rdquo;
was celebrated at St. Peter&rsquo;s Church, Cornhill, and
witnessed by John Pilgrim, of Norwich (the bride&rsquo;s
solicitor) and by her daughter Henrietta.&nbsp; The wedding day
was April 23rd.</p>
<p>There remained a very little business to do in London.&nbsp;
He had an interview with the General Purposes Committee of the
Bible Society, received a letter from Mr. Brandram, saying that
there was no sphere open &ldquo;to which your services in
connection with our Society can be transferred,&rdquo; and
quickly terminated his relations with Earl Street.&nbsp; In spite
of the little differences that had arisen, there was a generous
reference to Borrow in the Report of the Society for 1840.&nbsp;
He was said to have succeeded &ldquo;by almost incredible pains,
and at no small cost and hazard,&rdquo; in his last mission to
Spain, and to have assisted in circulating during five years
nearly fourteen thousand copies of the Scriptures.&nbsp; Thus the
Bible Society and Don Jorge said good-bye.</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>At
the beginning of May, Mr. and Mrs. Borrow and Miss Clarke went
down to Oulton.&nbsp; The Hall having been let to a farmer, they
took up their residence in a little house on the margin of the
Broad, known as Oulton Cottage.</p>

106</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE SUMMER HOUSE AT OULTON</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Borrow went to Oulton he was
thirty-seven.&nbsp; The comforts of the domesticity to which he
settled down were sweet, but its joys were of a very different
quality from those golden matrimonial projects of which he had
dreamed in Mumper&rsquo;s Dingle.&nbsp; He was older, sadder, if
not much wiser.&nbsp; He had modified the scale of his
ambitions.&nbsp; He was bent upon the acquisition of such fame as
he could attract through the avenue of literature, and not
disdainful of what local celebrity might come his way.&nbsp; But
though he was not of the temperament to apostrophise with
Cowper&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Domestic happiness!&nbsp; Thou only
bliss<br />
Of Paradise that has survived the Fall!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>there is everything in favour of the supposition that, in
marrying Mrs. Clarke, Borrow wrought better for himself than a
man of his temperament usually has an actuarial expectation of
doing in matrimony.&nbsp; Moreover, he did infinitely better than
a great number of literary persons who have taken the plunge in
similar circumstances.&nbsp; There was no such tragedy <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>about his
marriage as befell his friend and neighbour Edward FitzGerald;
indeed, there was no tragedy at all.&nbsp; Its absence is due to
Mrs. Borrow&rsquo;s remarkable personality, her wifely qualities,
unfailing devotion to him in all his fads and moods and
whimsies.&nbsp; She was a perfect &ldquo;helpmeet&rdquo;; she
provided him with a buffer to absorb some of the shocks of
outrageous fortune; she was a patient amanuensis and an
indefatigable secretary.</p>
<p>The picture one constructs of his wife from the
materials&mdash;slight enough&mdash;that Borrow himself gives,
and from the correspondence extant, is that of the &ldquo;flower
of wifely patience&rdquo;&mdash;a woman in whom tact has been
developed to such a degree as to become a kind of extra
sense.&nbsp; She was married to one of the queerest specimens of
mankind that Nature ever evolved; yet she secured in their union
happiness for both.&nbsp; Her affection for him was true and
deep; it was strong enough even to prevail over idiosyncrasies
that might easily have been fatal to any chance of domestic
peace, to say nothing of marital bliss.&nbsp; She was one of the
women to whom &ldquo;patience hath such mild composure
given&rdquo; that even Borrow failed to destroy her equanimity
and self-possession.&nbsp; Behind her hero-worship appears now
and then an illuminating gleam of feminine commonsense&mdash;just
a shooting ray upon some foible; but whenever it seems likely to
show Borrow in a specifically unfavourable light it is
immediately switched off.</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>Near
the easternmost point of land in England, on the margin of Oulton
Broad, in a spot where the roar of the North Sea could be heard,
was the cottage in which the best of his remaining years were to
be passed.&nbsp; Here he was to prosecute amid the solemn
marshland the eternal search for truth and happiness, and to find
that the pursuit was even more difficult for him than for the
majority of mankind.&nbsp; The house contained few rooms, but
sufficient for the requirements of the little family, and its
quietude and isolation were special recommendations to Borrow in
the particular mood in which he then found himself.&nbsp; The
scenery was of a character for which he had strong affection, and
the place itself was linked with one or two of the powerful
emotions of his youth.&nbsp; The Broad stretched away from the
end of his garden, and he overlooked it from the summer-house he
built as a study.&nbsp; Behind the house: and almost surrounding
it, were plantations of pine trees.&nbsp; For the rest, only an
occasional tower or windmill broke the level horizon.&nbsp; The
scene is different, more varied, and much fuller of life at the
present day, when the virtues of the Broads as pleasure waters
and of the country round as a residential district have been
discovered and exploited.&nbsp; But in certain hours and seasons
it is easy to imagine Oulton as George Borrow knew it.</p>
<p>Miss Elizabeth Harvey has left us a picture of Borrow as the
friends of this period recalled <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>him. <a name="citation109"></a><a
href="#footnote109" class="citation">[109]</a>&nbsp; In his
wooden pavilion &ldquo;on the very margin of the water,&rdquo;
she tells us, &ldquo;he had many strange old books in various
languages.&nbsp; I remember he once put one before me, telling me
to read it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; I
replied.&nbsp; He said, &lsquo;You ought: it&rsquo;s your own
language.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was an old Saxon book.&nbsp; He used to
spend a great deal of his time in this room, writing,
translating, and at times singing strange words in a stentorian
voice, while passers-by on the lake would stop to listen with
astonishment and curiosity to the singular sounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
note on his personal appearance, by the same hand, may help to
keep his figure in mind: &ldquo;He was six feet three, a splendid
man, with handsome hands and feet.&nbsp; He wore neither
whiskers, beard, nor moustache.&nbsp; His features were very
handsome, but his eyes were peculiar, being round and rather
small, but very piercing, and now and then fierce.&nbsp; He would
sometimes sing one of his Romany songs, shake his fist at me, and
look quite wild.&nbsp; Then he would ask, &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you
afraid of me?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No, not at all,&rsquo; I would
say.&nbsp; Then he would look just as gentle and kind, and say,
&lsquo;God bless you, I would not hurt a hair of your
head.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Here was he, then, when he set up
author in real <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>earnest, and induced &ldquo;glorious John&rdquo; to
publish the first book that resulted from his adventures in
foreign parts.&nbsp; This was &ldquo;The Zincali; or, An Account
of the Gypsies of Spain, with an Original Collection of their
Songs and Poetry, and a Copious Dictionary of their
Language.&rdquo;&nbsp; Most of the compilation&mdash;for such it
is, and a desultory compilation at that&mdash;had been made
during his five years in Spain.&nbsp; It was written at odd
times, &ldquo;chiefly in ventas and posadas, whilst wandering
through the country in the arduous and unthankful task of
distributing the Gospel among its children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In its published form &ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo; was an amalgam
of several schemes that had occurred to the author from time to
time during his Spanish wanderings.&nbsp; He had projected a
collection of the rhymes and proverbial sayings of the gypsies of
Spain, inspired thereto by the material he had gathered at
Badajoz and Merida, to which additions were made some years later
at Seville with the assistance of Juan Antonio Bailly, a French
courier with a considerable acquaintance among the
C&acirc;l&eacute;.&nbsp; He had also proposed a glossary of
C&acirc;lo and English, which afterwards resolved itself into a
limited vocabulary of words occurring in the songs and sayings
that he and Bailly had collected.&nbsp; Both these schemes were
imperfectly executed.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s knowledge of the
Spanish-gypsy language was quite empirical, and Bailly&rsquo;s
collections were either written by illiterate persons, or taken
<a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>down
from the lips of people who spoke a corrupted jargon.&nbsp;
Borrow and Bailly made a large number of translations from
obscure Spanish authors&mdash;and this was the material from
which &ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo; was constructed.&nbsp; He eked it
out with a quantity of out-of-the-way information and anecdote
acquired during his association with gypsies in England and
Russia, and in the course of much miscellaneous browsing among
books.&nbsp; A more unscientific process of writing &ldquo;An
Account of the Gypsies of Spain, etc.,&rdquo; it would be hard to
devise.&nbsp; There were half a hundred works of more or less
utility which he might have consulted, and there is no evidence
that he had seen more than a tithe of that number.&nbsp; But,
<i>pari passu</i>, there is certainly no evidence that if he had
seen them all he would have produced a better book.&nbsp; In
fact, here, as in every other case, his work does not depend for
its charm and its value upon any scientific basis whatever, but
upon the idiosyncrasies of Borrow himself, the mordant style, the
quaint observation, the atmosphere with which he contrives to
invest his subject.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo; was read at
first, as it is read now, not so much for the accuracy of its
history or its philology as for its intrinsic interest as
literature.</p>
<p>Having put together at Oulton these notes, memoranda, rhymes,
translations, descriptions, and scraps of a gypsy vocabulary,
Borrow took the compost to John Murray, who agreed to publish an
edition of 750 copies.&nbsp; The book attracted certain <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>minds
attuned to the Borrovian spirit, and it was admitted to display
the supreme virtue of originality.&nbsp; The voice of Murray,
above all, was encouraging, and to Borrow that was the voice of
the &ldquo;M&aelig;cenas of British literature.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
spite of occasional difficulties, he held Mr. Murray in unfailing
honour, and was proud to have his work sealed with the
<i>cachet</i> of Albemarle Street.&nbsp; The close association of
the Murrays with Richard Ford, whose &ldquo;Handbook&rdquo; was
long the classic English work on Spain, had important results for
Borrow.&nbsp; Ford was living in retirement at Heavitree, near
Exeter&mdash;the haven where, half a century later, George
Gissing found rest in his last days&mdash;and to him the
manuscript of &ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo; was sent for critical
observation.&nbsp; Ford&rsquo;s knowledge of Spain was extensive
and peculiar, and he immediately perceived in Borrow a man after
his own heart, who preferred byways to highways, was full of
curious learning, and invariably took the unconventional outlook.
<a name="citation112"></a><a href="#footnote112"
class="citation">[112]</a>&nbsp; His criticism of the book was
what might have been expected.&nbsp; It took the form of a regret
that Borrow had not given <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>his readers more of himself
&ldquo;instead of the extracts from those blunder-headed old
Spaniards, who knew nothing about gypsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, on
the whole, both Murray and Ford were pleased.&nbsp; So were the
reviewers.&nbsp; As to the public, they bought the work very
slowly.&nbsp; It appeared in April, 1841, and by June only three
hundred copies had been sold.&nbsp; Murray explained this
genially by declaring that the state of politics had shed a
blight over literature; no book was selling, and Borrow&rsquo;s
only shared the fate of the rest.</p>
<p>But before this a new enterprise had been designed.&nbsp; It
was to be an account of Borrow&rsquo;s personal adventures while
engaged in the circulation of the Scriptures in the
Peninsula.&nbsp; The scheme appealed strongly to Ford, and Murray
thought well of it.&nbsp; Ford was &ldquo;delighted&rdquo; to
know that Borrow meditated such a work.&nbsp; &ldquo;The more odd
personal adventures the better, and still more so if dramatic;
that is, giving the exact conversations.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have given him much advice,&rdquo; said Ford in a letter to
Addington, &ldquo;to avoid Spanish historians and <i>poetry</i>
like prussic <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>acid; to stick to himself, his biography, and queer
adventures.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Borrow wrote to Ford: &ldquo;I shall
attend to all your advice.&nbsp; The book will consist entirely
of my personal adventures, travels, etc., in that country during
five years.&nbsp; I met with a number of strange characters, all
of whom I have introduced; the most surprising of them is my
Greek servant, who accompanied me in my ride of 1,500
miles.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again: &ldquo;&lsquo;The Bible in
Spain&rsquo; is a rum, very rum, mixture of gypsyism, Judaism,
and missionary adventure, and I have no doubt will be greedily
read.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here was the impulse from which arose
&ldquo;The Bible in Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The book which gave Borrow his first and greatest vogue was a
compilation based mainly on the letters he had sent home in the
form of reports to the Bible Society.&nbsp; They were
unquestionably the most remarkable reports from a literary point
of view, and the most unconventional from a religious point of
view, that had ever been received by the grave and reverend
seniors of Earl Street.&nbsp; The Society had been staggered once
or twice.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s confession that he was a little
&ldquo;superstitious,&rdquo; his reference to the
&ldquo;prophetess&rdquo; of Manzanares, his
&ldquo;luck&rdquo;&mdash;all these were foreign phrases, and
distasteful to the pundits of the Bible Society.&nbsp; They chid
Borrow; but they put up with him until the final disruption, and
now, when he applied for permission to use his letters in
connection with the new book, they treated him very <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>well.&nbsp;
There were some episodes&mdash;the squabble with Graydon among
them&mdash;for which they were not anxious to secure more
publicity, a very natural feeling; but, Borrow giving assurances,
they &ldquo;cheerfully forwarded the letters to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The relations between the Bible Society and this astounding
missionary of theirs provide a quaint chapter in literary
history.&nbsp; Throughout a great part of their intercourse with
him they seem to have remained in a state of bland and childlike
innocence with regard to the real character and the actual
personality of their agent.&nbsp; They were aware of his
eccentricity, but apparently blind to the causes from which the
eccentricity sprang.&nbsp; This was the quality which gave his
letters from Spain their value for the purposes of the book he
now began to edit.</p>
<p>The year 1841 was gloomy, with bad weather and much
disease.&nbsp; It was the year when the murrain first appeared in
Great Britain and spread havoc throughout the agricultural
districts.&nbsp; Of all men Borrow was most delicately affected
by the moods of Nature round him, most sympathetically
attuned&mdash;wild and fierce where Nature was fierce and wild,
gentle and sunny amid fair meads in fine weather.&nbsp; And
during this miserable year he found it hard to make progress with
his writing.&nbsp; Next spring the change came with a rush, cold
and dry, with bright days merging into a glorious summer.&nbsp;
The country called Borrow out.&nbsp; He tells us that he spent
most <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>of
his time riding his Arab horse &ldquo;over heaths and through the
green lanes of my native land,&rdquo; or staying at home and
fishing for big pike in the ponds near Oulton Broad, or basking
in the sun.&nbsp; He worshipped Sidi Habismilk, and the horse
worshipped his master so manifestly as almost to encourage the
belief that Borrow was really a &ldquo;horse-wizard.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Arab followed him about like a dog.&nbsp; But this magnetism
of his was not confined to horses; it was exercised equally over
dogs and cats.&nbsp; Miss Harvey mentions that when Borrow set
out from Oulton for a walk, he was often accompanied by two dogs
and a cat.&nbsp; Grimalkin would, of course, be satisfied with
much less pedestrianism than her master and the dogs, and would
turn back home after a quarter of a mile or so.&nbsp; These
diversions occupied him well into the summer.&nbsp; It was only
when the heat and his own laziness began to remind him of
sun-baked Andalusia that the big book came to his mind as a duty
to be done.&nbsp; In actual fact, it would seem that the bulk of
the manuscript was in the hands of Murray by the middle of the
year in the form of a fair copy made by Mrs. Borrow from the
letters and from the new connecting links which the author
scribbled, as he says, &ldquo;higgledypiggledy&rdquo; on the
blank leaves of account-books and the backs of envelopes.</p>
<p>The book was published in December, 1842, and dated
1843.&nbsp; Ford, whose interest in it was continuous, had given
Borrow much advice; he prophesied <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>success.&nbsp; &ldquo;Avoid words;
stick to deeds,&rdquo; was his counsel.&nbsp; There should be no
&ldquo;fine writing,&rdquo; but plenty of wild adventure,
&ldquo;journals . . . sorcery, Jews, Gentiles, rambles, and the
interior of Spanish prisons.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow was to
&ldquo;avoid rant and cant.&nbsp; Dialogues always tell; they are
dramatic, and give an air of reality.&rdquo;&nbsp; With how much
fidelity Borrow followed this advice needs no emphasis.&nbsp; How
accurate was Ford&rsquo;s diagnosis of the public taste the
sequel demonstrates.</p>
<p>There was a loud chorus of praise from the literary
papers.&nbsp; Those who had approved &ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo;
called their readers to witness how they had unerringly detected
the trail of true genius.&nbsp; The <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> and the
<i>Examiner</i> led the way.&nbsp; Ford wrote a p&aelig;an in the
<i>Edinburgh</i>; the <i>Quarterly</i> was sorry it had
overlooked the &ldquo;Gypsies,&rdquo; but made up for the
omission by its reception of &ldquo;The Bible.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
author became the lion of the hour; visiting London, he was
f&ecirc;ted with ambassadors and &ldquo;princes and members of
Parliament,&rdquo; as he wrote to his wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;On
Saturday night I went to a grand soir&eacute;e, and the people
came in throngs to be introduced to me.&nbsp; To-night I am going
to the Bishop of Norwich, to-morrow to another place, and so
on.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was overwhelmed with congratulations from
private friends, among whose letters those of Hasfeldt from St.
Petersburg gave him most pleasure.&nbsp; Six editions of the book
were sold in England before the end of the <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>year; it
was pirated in America by three houses; it was translated into
French, German, and Russian.&nbsp; Borrow was the most
scintillating star in the literary firmament of 1843.</p>
<p>The book deserved its success.&nbsp; It has all the Borrovian
merits and few of the Borrovian defects.&nbsp; There is the charm
of the wonderful style, which is no style at all, the crisp
sentence, the unexpected epithet, the penetrating phrase, jumpy
and abrupt, but compelling the reader to take the jump and make
the sudden halt because it is the only thing to do.&nbsp; There
is the astonishing variety of adventure, of character, of colour,
of scene, the wealth of incident, the compelling force of
narrative.&nbsp; Ford said that Borrow &ldquo;sometimes put him
in mind of Gil Blas; <a name="citation118"></a><a
href="#footnote118" class="citation">[118]</a> but he had not the
sneer of the Frenchman, nor did he gild the bad.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There was, he added, a touch of Bunyan in the way in which, like
that enthusiastic tinker, he hammered away at the Devil, or his
man-of-all-work on earth&mdash;the Pope.&nbsp; It was, in fine,
such a book as had never been placed in the hands of the public
which now read it with tremendous avidity&mdash;the public
interested in foreign missions, in the propagation of the Gospel
in foreign parts&mdash;in a word, &ldquo;the religious
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; coloured
with all the hues of romance the great work <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>of
disseminating the Scriptures; it introduced them to new people
and to new scenes; it candied the villainies of gypsies with the
frosted sugar of evangelical effort, and if it recited strange
things of superstitious papists and dubious prophetesses, was not
the guide who introduced these matters to them &ldquo;a devout
agent of the Bible Society,&rdquo; whose end justified all the
means he sought?&nbsp; The &ldquo;polyglot gentleman&rdquo; was
the most piquant sensation that had ever made its way into
thousands of English drawing-rooms.</p>
<p>It was obvious that so great a success must be followed up,
and &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; was hardly in the press
before Borrow was pondering a scheme for a book to follow
it.&nbsp; For many reasons, the matter was long in
maturing.&nbsp; The chief of them, probably, was Borrow&rsquo;s
health.&nbsp; As he grew older, his innate melancholy deepened
into hypochondria, from which he emerged occasionally with fits
of high-strung merriment.&nbsp; At forty years of age he had
lived three ordinary lives.&nbsp; He was irritable and eccentric,
the irresponsible victim of megrims.&nbsp; Success did not
sweeten life for him.&nbsp; While he was the literary lion of
London, he growled at those who f&ecirc;ted and flattered him as
though he would devour them.&nbsp; He was certainly an admirer of
George Borrow himself, and he was not displeased with the
flattery; but it left him unsatisfied.&nbsp; Hasfeldt, with whom
he still corresponded, noted his unrest, rallied him, tried to <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>cheer him,
adjuring him to philosophy.&nbsp; But the lack of peace was the
effect of a deeper cause than Hasfeldt&rsquo;s friendly soul
could divine; deeper than Borrow himself could plumb.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I did very wrong not to bring you when I
came&rdquo; (so he wrote to his wife from London, when at the
zenith of his social success and at the nadir of mental and
spiritual tribulation), &ldquo;for without you I cannot get on at
all.&nbsp; Left to myself, a gloom comes upon me which I cannot
describe. . . .&nbsp; My place seems to be in our own dear
cottage, where, with your help, I hope to prepare for a better
world. . . .&nbsp; The poor bird when in trouble has no one to
fly to but his mate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His condition displayed itself in ridiculous quarrels with his
neighbours, particularly about the conflicts in which their dogs
were involved.&nbsp; It was characteristic of Borrow that he
would never admit his own dog to be in the wrong.&nbsp; One
dispute is set out by Dr. Knapp in a formal correspondence with
the vicar of Oulton.&nbsp; The parson described the Borrow dog as
&ldquo;a beast of a very quarrelsome and savage
disposition.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow retorted that the animal was
&ldquo;a harmless house-dog.&rdquo;&nbsp; The last passage of
Borrow&rsquo;s last letter on the subject was:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Circumstances over which Mr. Borrow at
present has no control will occasionally bring him and his family
under the same roof with Mr. Denniss; that roof, however, is the
roof of the House of God, and the prayers of the Church of
England are wholesome from whatever mouth they may
proceed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>He
became absolutely furious when a railway was taken through his
estate and past his house by one of the schemes of Sir Morton
Peto.</p>
<p>It was in this temper that he began the book which was to stir
generations into controversy, to arouse bitter criticism and
tremendous recrimination, to destroy for his lifetime the
literary reputation that Borrow had earned&mdash;the book
destined, in the irony of fate, to be that upon which such share
of immortality as Borrow possesses will probably rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; passed through many mutations while it
was planning and writing.&nbsp; The idea of an autobiography had
been suggested by Ford, who wanted him to publish his
&ldquo;whole adventures for the last twenty years,&rdquo;
describing the countries he had visited, discussing the languages
he knew, and treating of the people he had lived with.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;reader&rdquo; who had pronounced judgment for Murray upon
the manuscript of &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; had thought it
would be well to prefix to that narrative some pages of
autobiographical matter.&nbsp; These hints fructified early, for
&ldquo;The Bible&rdquo; had hardly issued from the press before
he was suggesting to Murray another book: &ldquo;Capital subject:
early life, studies and adventures; some account of my father,
William Taylor, Whiter, Big Ben, etc. etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His first plan was more coherent and more comprehensive than
the book in its published form; it <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>was to be an actual autobiography in
three volumes, the first to take him to the time of his
father&rsquo;s death, the second to describe his literary life in
London and his adventures on the road, and to proceed to his
travels abroad; the third to give his adventures in Russia and
carry him through a journey in Barbary and Turkey, which yet
remained to be undertaken.&nbsp; The first part of the scheme was
faithfully carried out, though Borrow wrote very slowly.&nbsp;
Throughout the early correspondence on the subject with Murray,
he referred to the book as &ldquo;My Life: A Drama.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was not till October, 1843, that he mentioned the title
&ldquo;Lavengro: A Biography.&rdquo;&nbsp; Next month he told
Murray that he had reached his Irish experiences.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am now in a blacksmith&rsquo;s shop in the south of Ireland,
taking lessons from the Vulcan in horse-charming and horse-shoe
making.&rdquo;&nbsp; In January, 1844, he described it in a
letter to Dawson Turner, of Yarmouth, the collector of
manuscripts, as &ldquo;a kind of biography in the Robinson Crusoe
style.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was much more difficulty in stringing
together the &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; episodes than in editing the
letters from Spain.&nbsp; He was writing from memory of matters
twenty or thirty years old, not visualising recent travels with
the assistance of documents made on the spot.&nbsp; Further, he
laboured under a sense of the necessity for doing something
specially fine in order that his new book might not endanger the
reputation he had obtained with his last.&nbsp; &ldquo;People
will expect <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>so much,&rdquo; he wrote to Murray.&nbsp; &ldquo;I go
on . . . scribbling away, though with a palpitating
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ford, who visited him at Oulton (January,
1844), was enthusiastic about the book, but disapproved of
Borrow&rsquo;s scheme for dropping several years (&ldquo;the
veiled period&rdquo;&mdash;1826 to 1833): &ldquo;I shall be most
anxious,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;to hear you tell your own story
and recent adventures; but first let us lift up a corner of the
curtain over <i>those seven years</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow was
enthusiastic, too, in the intervals of sunshine that lit up his
melancholy life.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; progresses
steadily, but I am in no hurry.&nbsp; It is my third book.&nbsp;
Hitherto the public has said: &lsquo;Good!&nbsp;
<i>Better</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; I want it to say to No. 3,
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Best</span>!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was remarkable that he had been content to remain four
years at Oulton, even though the monotony was varied by
occasional visits to London and tours through East Anglia on his
Arab horse.&nbsp; The wandering spirit which possessed him from
the cradle to the grave had been suppressed with difficulty, and
by the aid of circumstances which were inimical to schemes of
travel and adventure.&nbsp; It was not for lack of effort on
Borrow&rsquo;s part that he did not spend those years in going up
and down the world and to and fro in it.&nbsp; He had hardly
begun &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; before he was recommencing
the kind of campaign which marked the early
&rsquo;thirties&mdash;worrying Lord Clarendon to get him made a
consul or to engage him in some work abroad for the
Government.&nbsp; <a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>Lord Clarendon politely told him that it was
&ldquo;quite hopeless&rdquo; to ask Palmerston for a consulship;
and apparently Borrow was unable to make any definite suggestion
for the useful employment of his philological learning in any
travelling commission on behalf of the nation.&nbsp; These
schemes dropped; he had dreams of settling in Berlin, and others,
provoked by Hasfeldt, of studying the sagas in Copenhagen; they
were succeeded by visions of travel in North Africa, in search of
the wandering sect of the Dar-Bushi-Fal and the witch-hamlet,
Char Seharra, to which there are mysterious references in the
sixth chapter of &ldquo;The Zincali.&rdquo;&nbsp; But none of
these enterprises came to a head, and he performed the
uncongenial role of a stay-at-home till, having worked just over
a year upon the manuscript of &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; he suddenly
determined to take a prolonged tour abroad.&nbsp; Starting on
April 23rd, 1843, he proceeded by way of Paris to Strasburg and
Vienna, travelled through Hungary, Transylvania, and Rumania to
Bucharest, across the Danube, and from Rustchuk to
Constantinople, where he was in September.&nbsp; Thence he went
to Salonika, through Thessaly and Albania to Prevesa, afterwards
visiting Corfu and Venice, returning by Rome, Marseilles, Paris,
and Havre to London, which he reached in the middle of
November.&nbsp; Dr. Knapp gives the itinerary.&nbsp; This is one
of the few expeditions of which Borrow left no records save those
worked into late editions of &ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo; and <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>into the
Hungarian&rsquo;s narrative in &ldquo;The Romany Rye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having satiated his roving demon for a time, Borrow returned
to Oulton and resumed work upon &ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; By
this time he had completed the first volume, covering the period
to his father&rsquo;s death, which is the most authentically
autobiographical part of the book.&nbsp; Henceforward his plans
underwent a gradual change, and ultimately the original scheme
went completely adrift.&nbsp; Borrow was tossed about in the
eddies of his passions and prejudices as a cork in a
whirlpool.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; took charge of him.&nbsp;
Progress seemed to be slower than ever; the work dragged more
desperately as the departure from the first plan grew more
marked.</p>
<p>He took some consolation in the visit of Ford, already
mentioned.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; wrote Ford from Oulton
Hall, &ldquo;on a visit to El Gitano: two rum coves in a queer
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he gives, in a letter to Addington
(January 26th, 1844), a delicious picture of the place and their
pursuits:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This is a regular Patmos, an <i>ultima
Thule</i>, placed in an angle of the most unvisited,
out-of-the-way portion of England.&nbsp; His house hangs over a
lonely lake covered with wild fowl, and is girt with dark firs,
through which the wind sighs sadly.&nbsp; However, we defy the
elements, and chat over <i>las cosas de Espana</i>, and he tells
me portions of his life, more strange even than his book.&nbsp;
We scamper by day over the country in a sort of gig, which
reminds me of Mr. Weare on his trip with Mr. Thurtell
(Borrow&rsquo;s old preceptor).&nbsp; &lsquo;Sidi
Habismilk&rsquo; is in the stable and a zamarra now before me,
writing as I am in <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>a sort of summer-house, called <i>La Mezquita</i>, in
which <i>El Gitano</i> concocts his lucubrations, and
<i>paints</i> his pictures, for his object is to colour up and
poetise his adventures.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After Ford had left, Borrow wrote to him a letter <a
name="citation126a"></a><a href="#footnote126a"
class="citation">[126a]</a> which provides an interesting glimpse
at the process of composition of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">An
Batuscha</span>,&mdash;I have got your letter, which I should
have answered sooner had I not been to Yarmouth&mdash;not,
however, to the house of the Armenian.&nbsp; Thank you for the
pheasants and the caviare which you were kind enough to
send.&nbsp; Almost as soon as I got back from Norwich the weather
became disagreeable&mdash;a strange jumble of frost, fog, and
wet.&nbsp; I am glad that during your stay there it has been a
little more favourable.&nbsp; My wife is better, and left her
room, but poor Henrietta is in bed with the same complaint.&nbsp;
I still keep up, but not exactly the thing.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t
think how I miss you in our chats by the fireside.&nbsp; The
wine, now I am alone, has lost its flavour, and the cigar makes
me ill.&nbsp; I am very frequently by the Valley of the Shadow,
and, had I not summers and jaunts to look forward to, I am afraid
it would be all up with your friend, su Batuscha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still go on with my life, but slowly, lazily.&nbsp;
What I write is, however, good.&nbsp; I feel it is good: strange
and wild as it is.&nbsp; I expect to be in London by the
beginning of March, and hope there to write your review <a
name="citation126b"></a><a href="#footnote126b"
class="citation">[126b]</a> and receive a cheque from Murray to
the tune of some hundreds.&nbsp; The colt is, however, not bought
yet.&nbsp; My wife has set her face against it, and at present I
do not like to press the matter.&nbsp; She is in delicate health,
and believes she has dreamt it would either kill her or me.&nbsp;
At present I may truly call myself <i>el necio de la casa</i>,
<i>pero veremos vir</i>.&nbsp; She much regrets not having seen
you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I go to London upon whom would you advise me to
call?&nbsp; Who is worth knowing?&nbsp; Now that the old man is
<a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>dead, I
am afraid that a certain street will not be quite so agreeable as
it was.&nbsp; Did the gypsies tell you where they lived?&nbsp; If
I knew I would go and visit them.&nbsp; I suppose somewhere about
Tottenham Court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I returned from Norwich I stopped at Thurton and
tasted the wine.&nbsp; It was really good.&nbsp; When you are
next past that way you must taste it yourself, and give me your
opinion.&nbsp; I hope . . . having found your way to these parts
you will frequently favour us with your company.&nbsp; God bless
you.&nbsp; Ever yours,</p>

128</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;LAVENGRO&rdquo; AND HIS
CRITICS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> this period Borrow suffered
frequently from attacks of melancholia; little vexations upset
him terribly.&nbsp; He was more than once assaulted by roughs
while on his way home to Oulton from Lowestoft, and the remedy
that occurred to him was that he should be made a magistrate so
that he might take short measures with the ruffians who infested
the woods.&nbsp; He applied in various quarters for this
appointment.&nbsp; But the Whigs were in and Borrow was a
Tory.&nbsp; Neither the influence of Lockhart nor the admiration
which Gladstone entertained for &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo;
sufficed to prevail against the eternal principle of &ldquo;the
spoils to the victors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with this episode, as may be imagined, several
persons were placed upon Borrow&rsquo;s index.&nbsp; Lockhart
himself soon got there.&nbsp; When Ford&rsquo;s &ldquo;Handbook
for Spain&rdquo; appeared, the author was exceedingly anxious
that Borrow should write the article on it for the <i>Quarterly
Review</i>.&nbsp; No man could have done it with ampler knowledge
or invested it with more absorbing interest than &ldquo;El
Gitano,&rdquo; as Lockhart dubbed him in the correspondence on <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>the
subject.&nbsp; But the essay Borrow produced, written in
ill-health, and betraying all the evidences of a jaundiced and
embittered mind, was in no sense a review of Ford&rsquo;s
book.&nbsp; It was a long screed against those persons and
tendencies in Spanish politics that aroused his ire.&nbsp; The
extract given by Dr. Knapp is in the very best invective style of
the Appendix.&nbsp; Lockhart behaved exceedingly well in the
matter.&nbsp; He would publish the article in the
<i>Quarterly</i> if Borrow would permit him to insert extracts
from Ford&rsquo;s book in suitable places, so that the reader
might be able to obtain some glimmering of the author&rsquo;s
style and subject.&nbsp; Borrow petulantly replied that he would
not have the paper tampered with.&nbsp; Lockhart then very
properly exercised his editorial authority, and refused to
publish it.&nbsp; He softened the decision by suggesting that
Borrow&rsquo;s work would make an admirable magazine article,
mentioning periodicals that would be glad to have it.&nbsp; The
suggestion was not adopted, the article remained in proof-sheet
in the hands of Murray, and Lockhart was numbered among the
increasing army of Borrow&rsquo;s mortal enemies.&nbsp; It was an
unhappy sequel to this incident that the friendship between Ford
and Borrow cooled off, and their intercourse ceased altogether a
few years later&mdash;by no desire of Ford&rsquo;s, as the
correspondence shows.</p>
<p>More trouble arose from the obscure dispute with Bowring, in
which Borrow accused him of palming off upon the House of Commons
as his own the <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>Manchu-Tartar version of the Scriptures that Borrow had
printed at St. Petersburg, in order to get for himself the
consulship at Canton, while at the same time affecting to promote
the candidature of Borrow for the post.&nbsp; To any impartial
mind the evidence in favour of this theory is scanty, and the
theory itself improbable.&nbsp; That Borrow believed it there can
be no doubt; it tinged his life with added gall and wormwood, and
helped to divert the course and purpose of his book.&nbsp; A
further grievance was the failure of the British Museum trustees
to get the funds for a mission to the Convent of St. Catharine on
Sinai in search of the manuscript of the fourth-century Greek
Testament, afterwards acquired by Tischendorf for Alexander II.
of Russia.&nbsp; But it would be tiresome to follow all the
convolutions of Borrow&rsquo;s tempers and jealousies throughout
these troubled years.&nbsp; They are amply reflected in many
portions of the literary work he was doing.</p>
<p>Time drifted, and it was 1848 before Murray could make a
definite announcement about &ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; In that
year appeared in his &ldquo;list of new works in
preparation&rdquo; the
following:&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo;: An
Autobiography.&nbsp; By George Borrow, author of &lsquo;The Bible
in Spain,&rsquo; etc. 3 vols., post 8vo.&rdquo;&nbsp; In October
the first volume went to press, and then there was more
vacillation about the title of the book.&nbsp; It was advertised
in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> and the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> in
November, and December as &ldquo;Life: A Drama.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>That form
was immediately dropped.&nbsp; Borrow was taken ill and work
ceased.&nbsp; In July, 1849, the old advertisement describing it
as an autobiography was restored, though we well know now that by
this time it had ceased to be autobiographical in the
conventional sense.&nbsp; Finally the pangs of labour ended with
the year 1850, and &ldquo;Lavengro&mdash;The Scholar&mdash;The
Gypsy&mdash;The Priest&rdquo; was delivered to the reading world
and to the tender mercies of the critics in February, 1851.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the autobiographical claim was abandoned
at the last.&nbsp; In the preface, which he accomplished just in
time to get it to press, Borrow modified his description of the
book: &ldquo;In the following pages I have endeavoured to
describe a <i>Dream</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Later he denied that he
ever said it was an autobiography, or that he ever authorised
anybody else to say it was; this in spite of the advertisements
quoted above, and of the general impression he had allowed to be
created that he was writing an account of his life.</p>
<p>Yet, in fact, &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; is little else.&nbsp; It
followed faithfully the original plan throughout the first
volume.&nbsp; Then came Borrow&rsquo;s journey in the East and
his return to accumulate hatreds, nurse revenges, and conduct
wordy war with the battalions of his imaginary foes.&nbsp; And,
in order to vent his spleen upon them, he deliberately altered
the tenour of his book.&nbsp; The episodes of travel on the
English roads <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>were already protracting themselves beyond manageable
length when events occurred that determined him to reject the
whole scheme of the two remaining volumes first designed, and to
extend these episodes still further so as to drag in some of his
pet aversions and exhibit them in a disgraceful or ridiculous
light.&nbsp; Particularly did he pour forth the vials of his
wrath upon Bowring, the Old Radical, inserting the incident of
the postilion and his story specially for the purpose.</p>
<p>But while Borrow was down in the summer-house at Oulton
writing marvellous pages on odd scraps of paper, probing profound
depths of speculation, and rising to the dizziest heights of
natural eloquence, while he allowed himself to be possessed and
fascinated by the gypsies and the jockeys, the tramps and the
wastrels, the thimble-engroes and the pugilists, and all the
weird company that defile through the haunting pages of his book,
while the development of Catholic missions in England diverted
his ultra-Protestant mind to the machinations of mythical Jesuits
and gave him the figure of the Man in Black; while he piled rage
and scorn upon the devoted head of John Bowring, who added to his
other sins against the Borrovian covenant a characteristically
Unitarian indifference to the &ldquo;No Popery&rdquo; cry <a
name="citation132"></a><a href="#footnote132"
class="citation">[132]</a>&mdash;all this time
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; was not making much progress with his
life, the publisher was appealing to him to hurry, and <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>the hungry
printer was sending up pitiable cries for
&ldquo;copy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow, having gone off on a branch
line, utterly declined to return.&nbsp; He had occupied nearly
two volumes in describing the events of a few months&mdash;from
his descent upon London and Sir Richard Phillips to his sojourn
in Mumper&rsquo;s Dell.&nbsp; He was in the middle of the
postilion&rsquo;s story, wherein the Old Radical was receiving
his shrewdest knocks, when Murray issued his ultimatum, and Mrs.
Borrow was despatched to London with the last of the manuscript
(November, 1850).&nbsp; He had been obliged to break off
abruptly, for Murray threatened, if the book were not finished
there and then, to &ldquo;throw it up.&rdquo;&nbsp; Promising
himself to complete the narrative in a sequel, Borrow left
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; as we have it now.&nbsp; The reviewers and
the reading world, instead of the autobiography in common form
which they had been led to expect, received a picaresque
hotch-potch about which the best they could find to say was that
it was &ldquo;remarkable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The almost unanimous verdict of the critics was highly
unfavourable.&nbsp; The <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> (whose review was
written by Dilke) spoke of the warm expectations that had been
raised and the great disappointment that was felt; <i>Fraser</i>,
in which William Stirling (Sir William Stirling-Maxwell)
discussed it, was vigorously satirical about Borrow&rsquo;s
trivial mystifications, his dashes, dots, and asterisks;
<i>Blackwood</i> was &ldquo;sick of the Petulengros and their
jargon,&rdquo; and its reviewer <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>acutely perceived the internal
evidence of the changes in plan and disposition which had been
made while the work was in progress.&nbsp; The two persons who
found anything good to say about the book were friends of
Borrow&mdash;Dr. Gordon Hake and Mr. W. B. Donne.&nbsp; It is
curious that these were the only reviewers who displayed much
prescience in their criticism.&nbsp; Hake took the bold course of
prophecy: &ldquo;Lavengro&rsquo;s&rdquo; roots, he said, would
strike deep into the soil of English letters.&nbsp; Donne
perceived that, as he said, the public had been looking for a
second Marco Polo, and were presented instead with a
nineteenth-century Defoe.</p>
<p>In spite, however, of all that could be said in its favour,
the public would have none of &ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; Three
thousand copies of the first edition were printed.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding Murray&rsquo;s confident prophecy that it would
find a ready sale, it fell almost lifeless, and twenty-one years
passed before another edition was called for.&nbsp; It is a
little difficult to understand the attitude of the public and the
Press towards a work which, in spite of its obvious faults, is
one of the most virile and most entrancing works of English
literature.&nbsp; The true explanation is to be found in the
theory suggested by Mr. Watts-Dunton.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; was a complete failure, he said, and its
reception by the Press, the accusations of &ldquo;lowness and
vulgarity,&rdquo; embittered Borrow.&nbsp; Why was it that the
public of that day considered such books as <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo;
to be low and vulgar?&nbsp; The fact was that
&ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; issuing forth in the year of the great
Exhibition, made its bow before the most genteel and most
philistine age of Victorian literature.&nbsp; A writer hardly
dared to admit that a man was a man or a woman a woman.&nbsp; We
have arrived at the other extreme in the process of emancipating
ourselves from philistinism, and there is no excuse in Art or
Nature for many of the books written and published at the present
time.&nbsp; But the reception of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; was
largely due to the mawkish sentiment against which Borrow
hysterically declaimed as &ldquo;gentility-nonsense,&rdquo; and
we have fortunately outgrown it.&nbsp; In time readers came to
see the extraordinary merits of Borrow&rsquo;s books; they bought
them as they were re-issued, read them, liked them, and will go
on reading and liking them.&nbsp; Gypsyism has, in fact, become
popular in the genteelest circles.</p>
<p>Many years ago Mr. Watts-Dunton succeeded in throwing a gleam
of light upon Borrow&rsquo;s own view of the work.&nbsp; He tells
us how, when they were discussing the question of the real nature
of autobiography, Borrow exclaimed, &ldquo;What is an
autobiography?&nbsp; Is it a mere record of the incidents of a
man&rsquo;s life, or is it a picture of the man himself&mdash;his
character, his soul?&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mr. Watts-Dunton adds
observations applying the inference to Borrow&rsquo;s book.&nbsp;
He points out what we have already seen&mdash;<a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>that he sat
down to write his own life in &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; and that in
the first volume he did almost confine himself to matters of
fact.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, as he went on, he clearly found that the
ordinary tapestry into which destiny had woven the incidents of
his life was not tinged with sufficient depth of colour to
satisfy his sense of wonder.&nbsp; When he wishes to dive very
boldly into the &lsquo;abysmal deeps of personality,&rsquo; he
speaks and moves partly behind the mask of some fictitious
character.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let it be remembered,&rdquo; says
Mr. Watts-Dunton, &ldquo;that it was this instinct of wonder, not
the instinct of the mere <i>poseur</i>, that impelled him to make
certain exaggerated statements about the characters themselves
that are introduced into his books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This view of the eccentricities and purple patches of
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; is
interesting, and certainly just to a point.&nbsp; It does not
account for the whole of the leaps that Borrow took in one
direction and another; it does not explain Mr. Platitude, or the
Man in Black, or the Old Radical.&nbsp; The reason for their
creation has been already stated.&nbsp; The &ldquo;instinct of
wonder,&rdquo; the Celtic imagination, now brooding, now soaring,
does, however, explain much in the books that cannot be explained
by reference to actual facts of the author&rsquo;s career, and
does justify in a sense his theory of autobiography&mdash;that
the truest self-revelation may be found not so much in the mere
recital of bare facts as in the impression <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>of the form
of his thought, and in the reflection of the colours that glow in
his soul.</p>
<p>If the year of the great Exhibition was an unfortunate year
for the commercial fortunes of &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; the
Exhibition itself had certain irresistible attractions for
&ldquo;Lavengro&rsquo;s&rdquo; author.&nbsp; It had drawn to
London a large congregation of the peoples of the earth, and the
thought that in Hyde Park twenty languages were chiming a rare
cacophony was too much for him.&nbsp; He went off to town to see
the show, taking his step-daughter with him.&nbsp; The tall man
with the white hair, striding about under the glass roof, soon
began to create a minor sensation, which was by no means to the
liking of Miss Clarke.&nbsp; To see a group of foreigners in
converse was enough for him.&nbsp; He went up to them and
addressed them in their own tongue, and repeated the process so
often that it began to be whispered about that he was
&ldquo;uncanny,&rdquo; and he excited so much remark that his
daughter thought it better to drag him away.</p>
<p>While Borrow was at Oulton struggling with the composition of
&ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; quarrelling with the vicar, denouncing
Sir Morton Peto, procrastinating with his publisher, and passing
some of the most miserable, if the most fruitful years of his
life, he made an acquaintance which ripened into an important and
valuable friendship.&nbsp; The Misses Harvey introduced the
Borrows to Dr. Thomas Gordon Hake, then resident as a physician
at Bury St. Edmund&rsquo;s&mdash;<a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>the friendly critic of
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; already mentioned.&nbsp; Visits were paid
and repaid by the two families at Bury and at Oulton, and a close
association and familiarity grew up.&nbsp; Dr. Hake thus becomes
one of the most trustworthy and most interesting authorities on
this portion of Borrow&rsquo;s life, and relates many exceedingly
suggestive stories illustrating the varied and strangely
contradictory phases of Borrow&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; His
sketch of the personality of his friend, inscribed in his
&ldquo;Memoirs,&rdquo; has often been quoted.&nbsp; Its principal
value is that it brings out with the authority of a medical man
the cause of much that frequently seems inexplicable in
Borrow&mdash;his native hypochondria, and the reason for his
violent antipathy towards society, and especially
&ldquo;genteel&rdquo; society: &ldquo;Society he loved and hated
alike; he loved it that he might be pointed out and talked of; he
hated it because he was not the prince he felt himself in its
midst.&rdquo;&nbsp; I refer again in this connection to the view
proffered to me by Mr. Watts-Dunton, gleaned from intercourse
with Borrow at a later period of his life, that his denunciation
of respectability and &ldquo;gentility-nonsense&rdquo; was simply
by way of revenge upon the Philistines; that he loved real
respectability and good repute, worshipped fame and success, and
equally hated insignificance and failure.</p>
<p>Dr. Hake&rsquo;s anecdotes illustrate his impatience of much
of the kind of fame and notice he attracted, the outbursts of
violence with which he greeted people <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>who did not appeal to him, and the
intensity of his egoism.&nbsp; Poor Agnes Strickland was anxious
to be introduced to him, and, after expressing her great
admiration of his books, she begged to be allowed to send him a
copy of her &ldquo;Queens of England.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow cried,
&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t, madam; I should not know
what to do with them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, getting up, he said to
Mr. Donne, of the London Library, who had introduced the
ill-assorted pair, &ldquo;What a d&mdash; fool that woman
is!&rdquo;&nbsp; There was Mrs. Bevan, the wife of the Suffolk
banker, with whom he went to dine, Dr. Hake being of the
company.&nbsp; Borrow knew that the bank had dealt, as he
thought, rigorously with a friend who was in financial
straits.&nbsp; Mrs. Bevan, who, of course, had no responsibility
in this matter, sat next to Borrow at dinner.&nbsp; Dr. Hake
describes her as &ldquo;a simple, unpretending woman, desirous of
pleasing him,&rdquo; which she sought to do by describing the
pleasure with which she had read his books.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray,
what books do you mean, madam?&rdquo; said Borrow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you mean my account-books?&rdquo;&nbsp; And he rose
from the table, walking up and down the room during dinner, and
wandered about the house till the carriage was ordered.&nbsp;
There was Thackeray, whom he met at Hardwicke House, in
Suffolk.&nbsp; Thackeray ventured to ask him whether he had read
the &ldquo;Snob Papers&rdquo; in <i>Punch</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
<i>Punch</i>?&rdquo; said Borrow.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a periodical
I never look at!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>Instances of his boorishness could be multiplied, but
it is sufficiently proved.&nbsp; Let us see what there is on the
other side of the account.</p>
<p>There is a tale told by Mr. Ewing Ritchie <a
name="citation140"></a><a href="#footnote140"
class="citation">[140]</a> which illustrates the fact that Borrow
thoroughly detested the practice of snubbing&mdash;when he
witnessed it as a third person.&nbsp; A clergyman at the supper
table at Oulton Hall (then let to a tenant who was a
Nonconformist) made an onslaught upon a young Independent
minister for holding Calvinistic opinions.&nbsp; The occasion of
this Christian dispute was the more appropriate as they had all
just returned from an undenominational meeting of the Bible
Society, at which Borrow had made a speech.&nbsp; The minister
stood up to the cleric, and told him that the Thirty-nine
Articles to which he had sworn assent were Calvinistic.&nbsp; The
reply to this was that there was a mode of explaining away the
Articles: we were not bound to take the words &ldquo;in their
natural sense.&rdquo;&nbsp; The young Nonconformist confessed
that he did not understand that way out of the difficulty, and
subsided.&nbsp; Then Borrow stepped into the fray, &ldquo;opening
fire on the clergyman,&rdquo; says Mr. Ritchie, &ldquo;in a very
unexpected manner, and giving him such a setting-down as the
hearers, at any rate, never forgot.&nbsp; All the sophistry about
the non-natural meaning of terms was held up by Borrow to
ridicule, and the clergyman was beaten at every
point.&rdquo;&nbsp; The comment of the <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>young
minister to Mr. Ritchie was, &ldquo;Never did I hear one man give
another such a dressing as on that occasion.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
very like to be tremendous when Borrow had his Protestant bonnet
on and at the same time thought he saw a member of the Church he
loved making himself ridiculous.</p>
<p>The interview between Borrow and the Rev. Whitwell Elwin has
been previously mentioned (p. <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page52">52</a></span>).&nbsp; &ldquo;What party are you in
the Church?&rdquo; he suddenly exclaimed to the Rector of
Booton.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tractarian, Moderate, or Evangelical?&nbsp;
I am happy to say <i>I</i> am the old High.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am happy to say I am <i>not</i>,&rdquo; replied Elwin.&nbsp; A
conversation thus begun with unpromising differences of opinion
about the ethics of review-writing, and continued in an
atmosphere of theological disputation, would ordinarily have
ended in a violent quarrel.&nbsp; Borrow must have been in an
especially benignant mood that day, for he allowed Elwin to throw
aspersions upon his pronunciation of the Norfolk dialect, and yet
did not bring the <i>s&eacute;ance</i> to a conclusion with
lightning in his eyes, thunder on his brows, and storms of
invective flowing from his eloquent tongue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Borrow
boasted,&rdquo; says Elwin, &ldquo;of his proficiency in the
Norfolk dialect, which he endeavoured to speak as broadly as
possible.&nbsp; I told him that he had not cultivated it with his
usual success.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the clouds cleared, the
protagonists became warm friends, and promised to visit each
other.&nbsp; It does not appear that Elwin ever went to <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>Oulton, but
Borrow did go to Booton, exerted himself to please his hosts by
calling upon his stores of anecdote and adventure, and entranced
the children of the rectory by singing gypsy songs to them.&nbsp;
It will be remembered that Elwin was then editing the
<i>Quarterly Review</i> as deputy for Lockhart.&nbsp; He begged
Borrow to &ldquo;try his hand at an article for the
<i>Review</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Borrow was far too sore with
reviews and reviewers to entertain such a proposal; the incident
of Ford&rsquo;s &ldquo;Handbook,&rdquo; too, was recent.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have made a
resolution never to have anything to do with such a blackguard
trade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Booton episode is related mainly because it offers an
opportunity of referring to a trait of Borrow which has been the
subject of strange misrepresentation.&nbsp; Dr. Jessopp wrote for
the <i>Daily Chronicle</i> <a name="citation142"></a><a
href="#footnote142" class="citation">[142]</a> a review of a new
edition of &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; in which the following
remarkable passage occurred:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of anything like animal passion there is
not a trace in all his many volumes.&nbsp; Not a hint that he
ever kissed a woman or ever took a little child upon his
knee.&nbsp; He was beardless; his voice was not the voice of a
man.&nbsp; His outbursts of wrath never translated themselves
into uncontrollable acts of violence; they showed themselves in
all the rancorous hatred that could be put into words&mdash;the
fire smouldered in that sad heart of his.&nbsp; Those big bones
and huge muscles and the strong brain were never to be reproduced
in an offspring to be proud of.&nbsp; How if he were the Narses
of literature&mdash;one who could be only what he was, though we
are always inclined to lament that he was not something
more?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>One
does not care to discuss the principal suggestion here involved,
save to say that there is not a tittle of evidence to support it,
that it cannot be believed by any student of some of the most
robust and most virile works in the English language, and that
the alleged facts upon which it is based have been categorically
contradicted by Mr. Thomas Hake (the eldest son of Dr. Gordon
Hake) in an interesting letter to Mr. Watts-Dunton. <a
name="citation143"></a><a href="#footnote143"
class="citation">[143]</a>&nbsp; This gentleman, the author of
several novels, who knew more of Borrow than anyone else, must
not be confounded with his younger brother, Mr. Egmont Hake
(mentioned on page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page8">8</a></span>), the well-known author of &ldquo;The
Story of Chinese Gordon.&rdquo;&nbsp; It will be a great pity if
Mr. Thomas Hake does not give us his reminiscences of the author
of &ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; One point, however, of Dr.
Jessopp&rsquo;s impeachment of Borrow may be taken up without
offence.&nbsp; There is not a hint, says Dr. Jessopp, that Borrow
&ldquo;ever kissed a woman or ever took a little child upon his
knee.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a new demand upon biographers that they
shall record, even by way of hint, the osculatory adventures of
their heroes, and possibly the best reply is that there is
certainly no hint that he never kissed a woman, and there is
plenty of testimony to the fact that he was no misogynist.&nbsp;
But if a hint will suffice it may be found in Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s account of the conversation <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>between
them and the gypsy woman Perpinia, whom he warned against smoking
tobacco while she was suckling an infant: &ldquo;It ought to be a
criminal offence for a woman to smoke at all,&rdquo; growled
Borrow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fancy kissing a woman&rsquo;s mouth that
smelt of stale tobacco&mdash;pheugh!&rdquo;&nbsp; The inference
is so obvious that one need not pursue the argument by inversion
of the story.&nbsp; When one comes to Dr. Jessopp&rsquo;s picture
of Borrow in his relation to children, however, there is a large
quantity of direct evidence gathered from many quarters which
proves it to be erroneous.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas Hake, in the letter
just cited, says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When our family lived at Bury St.
Edmund&rsquo;s in the &rsquo;fifties, my father, as you know, was
one of Borrow&rsquo;s most intimate friends, and he was
frequently at our house, and Borrow and my father were a good
deal in correspondence (as Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s book shows), and my
impression of Borrow is exactly the contrary of that which it
would be if he in the least resembled Dr. Jessopp&rsquo;s
description of him.&nbsp; At that time George was in the nursery
and I was a child.&nbsp; He took a wonderfully kind interest in
us all . . . but the one he took most notice of was George,
chiefly because he was a very massive child.&nbsp; It was then
that he playfully christened him &lsquo;Hales,&rsquo; because he
said that the child would develop into a second &lsquo;Norfolk
giant.&rsquo;&nbsp; You will remember that he always addressed
George by that name.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The truth is that Borrow was exceedingly fond of
children.&nbsp; He appealed strongly to them.&nbsp; No such
impression as he made upon the Elwin children at Booton, upon the
boys of Dr. Gordon Hake&rsquo;s family at Bury, upon the Cornish
children he encountered <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>in 1854 (p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page170">170</a></span>), was ever
made by a man who did not understand children and sympathise with
them.</p>
<p>The chronicle to the end of 1853 may be very briefly
recounted.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s mother had been persuaded in 1849
to leave the house in Willow Lane, Norwich, where she had lived
alone ever since his departure for St. Petersburg, and take up
her quarters with the family at Oulton.&nbsp; In the midst of the
writing of &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; in 1853, Dr. Hake ordered
Borrow&rsquo;s wife not to remain at Oulton during the coming
winter.&nbsp; Borrow himself welcomed the prospect of a change,
and in August he and the three women of his household removed to
Yarmouth, where they lived in lodgings for seven years, except
when they were engaged in the excursions which he presently
organised in various parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
<h2><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;SUCCESS TO OLD
CORNWALL!&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Borrow&rsquo;s</span> only journey to the
land of mystery and legend from which his family sprang was made
in 1853.&nbsp; It came about curiously.&nbsp; An incident
occurred, soon after he had taken up his residence in lodgings at
Yarmouth, which demonstrated both his personal courage and the
easy terms on which he always was with the water. <a
name="citation146"></a><a href="#footnote146"
class="citation">[146]</a>&nbsp; In the midst of a terrible storm
he dashed into the sea, himself saved one life from an overturned
boat, and assisted to rescue the rest of the people in
danger.&nbsp; He became the local hero of the hour, and an
account of his gallantry was printed in the <i>Bury Post</i>.</p>
<p>The Borrows of Cornwall had been mainly a home-keeping
race.&nbsp; The connection of George&rsquo;s branch with the
parent stem had been completely severed half a century before,
and the inhabitants of the Caradon Hills had altogether lost
sight of old <a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>Tom Borrow and his life.&nbsp; Now, however, the
<i>Plymouth Mail</i> reprinted from the Bury paper a paragraph
about the Yarmouth affair, and in process of time it was read at
St. Cleer.&nbsp; The appearance of a person by the name of Borrow
in this heroic shape was discussed with curiosity.&nbsp; Putting
two and two together, the Cornishmen came to the conclusion that
this celebrated author and saviour of drowning men could be none
other than the son of that Tom Borrow whose claim to fame among
them was that he had knocked down the headborough at Menheniot
Fair.</p>
<p>Many of the name were in the district.&nbsp; Henry Borrow, of
Looe Down, was a son of another Henry, George&rsquo;s uncle, and
therefore a cousin of the Romany Rye.&nbsp; Henry had a daughter,
Ann, married to Mr. Robert Taylor, of Penquite, a person of some
consideration in the locality.&nbsp; The upshot of the discussion
was that Mr. Taylor was requisitioned by the rest of the family
to invite the celebrity to Cornwall.&nbsp; In a letter of
acceptance, Borrow expressed the pleasure it gave him to receive
such an invitation, and the delight he felt in knowing that there
were still some who remembered his honoured father, who, he said,
had as true a Cornish heart as ever beat.</p>
<p>Thus he spent the Christmas of 1853 in the county of which he
was in the truest sense native; and of this atmosphere, most
genial to him, he breathed eagerly.&nbsp; Borrow never
accomplished the book he proposed to write about Cornwall.&nbsp;
An advertisement <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>of it was published at the end of &ldquo;The Romany
Rye,&rdquo; when he was fresh home from his visit and full of the
romance he had absorbed in the westernmost peninsula of
England.&nbsp; But, like many of his plans, it failed to come to
anything.&nbsp; If it had been written, it would probably have
been as full of good things as his Welsh book, and a better
whole, since it was a smaller and more manageable subject.&nbsp;
It will be possible presently to attempt to indicate the kind of
work this might have been.</p>
<p>He left Yarmouth on December 23rd, and, this time not
disdaining the services of the detested railway, was able to
reach Plymouth at midnight.&nbsp; In that day Plymouth was the
western terminus of the railway system.&nbsp; Brunel&rsquo;s
great bridge, which carries the iron road at a dizzy altitude
across the Tamar from Devonshire into Cornwall, was not raised
till six years later, and people who adventured into the land of
giants and saints, pilchards and pasties, must complete their
journey by coach.&nbsp; Having slept a night at the Royal Hotel
in Plymouth, Borrow found that the Christmas traffic had crowded
the coach, and he arrived at the Borrovian determination to walk
to Liskeard, on the main road eighteen miles away, the nearest
town to his objective among the hills.&nbsp; Leaving his luggage
to be carried on by the mail, he &ldquo;threw his cloak on his
arm (a very old friend which had seen some thirty years&rsquo;
service, the constant companion of his travels&rdquo;), and
trudged off to <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>Devonport, across the Tamar by the ferry, and along the
enchanting sylvan highway to the town whose representative in
Parliament was just then laying about the &ldquo;Puseyites&rdquo;
in a fashion most agreeable to Borrow.</p>
<p>There was a little stir in the bookish circles of the old
Cornish borough among whom Mr. Taylor had spread the news that
Borrow was coming, and a small party assembled to meet him and
lionise him.&nbsp; These were drawn up under the porch of
Webb&rsquo;s Hotel as the huge figure strode into view.&nbsp;
There was the ex-Mayor, Mr. Bernard Anstis.&nbsp; There was the
Town Clerk, Mr. James Jago, a connection of the Borrows by
marriage.&nbsp; There were his own relations.&nbsp; Happily,
under these new auspices, he dropped his affectation of objection
to be lionised, and took wine with his worshippers at the hotel
in quite a conventional manner.&nbsp; Then, after tea with the
Jago family, he and Taylor mounted horseback and rode off to
Penquite, four miles away, to spend an old-style rural
Christmas.&nbsp; &ldquo;A hospitable reception, with a log on the
fire&rdquo; was Borrow&rsquo;s own word for it&mdash;a brief but
hearty tribute to the effect it had upon him.&nbsp; On Christmas
Day he walked from Penquite to St. Cleer Church, about which his
notebooks mention that it lacked an organ (as it does to this
day), but that there was a fiddler in the gallery.&nbsp;
Returning over the noble expanse of St. Cleer Down, he was
introduced to a family of relations by marriage&mdash;the
Pollards&mdash;and in the afternoon walked to their <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>residence
at Woolston to have lively talk of travel with two sons who had
been in Australia, and to discuss the prehistoric memorials of
the district, which he describes as &ldquo;Druid
stones.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the Borrows have left St. Cleer, but the
Pollards are in possession of Penquite.</p>
<p>It may seem that one lingers over the details of a visit which
was but a small incident in Borrow&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; The excuse
must be offered that, if one could but penetrate the mystery of
what may be called the Spirit of Old Cornwall, one would be in
possession of the key to much that is mysterious in Borrow.&nbsp;
He had inherited it fully, and it shaped many of his most
pronounced characteristics.&nbsp; Here, if anywhere and at any
time, he was at home&mdash;far more at home than his father had
ever been; what freak of atavism may not account for that?&nbsp;
Where eyes look out upon a world of wonder and of miracle, where
even yet magic and supernatural intervention have their sway in
that world&rsquo;s affairs, and there is an underworld of faery,
where strange Celtic words are of common use and wont, the
philological, legend-loving wanderer was in a fitting
atmosphere.</p>
<p>Not many people remain in Cornwall now who can remember
Borrow, but a few years ago I found memories of the man and his
eccentricities still lively among old inhabitants.&nbsp; Borrow
amazed them not only by his personal peculiarities, but by his
intellectual superiority to &ldquo;they Borrowses.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There were <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>many Borrows round about, small farmers, excellent and
worthy undistinguished people, the friends and equals of their
neighbours; the staggering fact was that such a wonder, such a
celebrity, such a walking encyclop&aelig;dia of information on
matters of which they had never heard, should have sprung from
the Borrow stock.&nbsp; His &ldquo;curious ways&rdquo; were
subject of remark, but his popularity rose superior to his
manners: in a few short weeks he obtained a reputation for
liveliness hardly second to that of his father.</p>
<p>I have been told that he roamed the Caradons in all weathers
without a hat, in search of sport and specimens, antiquities and
dialects.&nbsp; He often carried a gun.&nbsp; If a bird that fell
to him dropped in a moorland pool, he would plunge in after it
and come out dripping water and beaming triumph.&nbsp; Little
parties he attended at Penquite, at the vicarage, at the houses
of friends in Liskeard, were</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . . As merry<br />
As, first, good company, good wine, good welcome<br />
Can make good people.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He himself kept the fireside circle roaring with his constant
flow of gypsy songs and stories.&nbsp; But it was an essential
point that the parties should not be genteel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; had not long been written, and he was then
engaged upon its sequel.&nbsp; Shortly he was to be
writing&mdash;if it were not already written&mdash;that chapter
of the Appendix on &ldquo;gentility-nonsense.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>It was, in
fact, just the zenith of the anti-gentility campaign.&nbsp; Once
he went from Penquite into Liskeard to dine with Mr. Bernard
Anstis.&nbsp; The despiteful demon seized him at the
ex-Mayor&rsquo;s hospitable board.&nbsp; Gentility showed its
cloven hoof in some form or other; in the midst of dinner Borrow
protested silently against the apparition by keeping his
handkerchief in his pocket and dragging out for ostentatious use
the old, greasy, rust-stained, powder-grimed rag he kept about
him for cleaning his gun during expeditions on the moors.&nbsp;
He seemed, said one, now departed (John Abraham, of Liskeard),
who related to me this story, to be &ldquo;perpetually repeating
to himself old Burton&rsquo;s maxim that &lsquo;of all vanities
and fopperies, to brag of gentility is the greatest.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Yet he was proud of the fact that his father derived from what he
called the Cornish
&lsquo;<i>gentill&acirc;tre</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Taylor
was a member of a card club in Liskeard, to which belonged the
doctors and lawyers and other professional gentlemen of the
town.&nbsp; Borrow was taken in to play cards with them.&nbsp;
But it was far too tame for him.&nbsp; While they settled down to
their rubber, he stole out to explore the back slums of the town,
&ldquo;picking up all the disreputable characters he could find,
working off his knowledge of &lsquo;cant&rsquo; on them, and
getting out of them what he could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow met at St. Cleer a kindred spirit in the vicar,
Berkeley.&nbsp; This was an Irishman of the North&mdash;<a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>not to put
too fine a point on it, an Orangeman,&mdash;a man of some
pretensions to learning and a great &ldquo;original,&rdquo; as
they might say in Cornwall.&nbsp; Berkeley&rsquo;s militant
Protestantism was quite as fierce as Borrow&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But
for a certain Irish cob, as he tells us, Borrow might have become
a mere philologist.&nbsp; It was in Ireland that he first
developed the taste for petty adventure which he now indulged to
the full in the wilds of Cornwall.&nbsp; Here was common
ground.&nbsp; Berkeley piled coals on the fire of his anti-Papist
enthusiasm.&nbsp; The good vicar was, withal, convivial in
disposition, exiled among a people cloaking their essential
kindness under a serious demeanour, and exceedingly
abstemious.&nbsp; He was open-hearted and open-handed when he had
money, which was not always.&nbsp; He suffered once at the hands
of ruthless bailiffs.&nbsp; As a burning Protestant, he was on
amicable terms with the Dissenters, who formed the majority of
his parishioners in Methodist Cornwall; he was a bitter enemy of
Ritualism, and &ldquo;Popery&rdquo; was his <i>b&ecirc;te
noire</i>.&nbsp; This piquant personality presided over the
destinies of the parish of St. Cleer at a time when the fortunes
of the Church of England reached their lowest ebb in Cornwall,
and the Methodist societies flourished like the green
bay-tree.&nbsp; It is related that for a considerable time the
only regular attendant at church, in addition to the parson, was
a schoolmaster of episcopal sympathies, who walked a mile and a
half of a Sunday morning to hear Berkeley&rsquo;s denunciation <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>of the
Papists echoing through an empty building.</p>
<p>Berkeley was one of those Irish Protestants to whom Borrow had
paid tribute as a &ldquo;most remarkable body of men who during
two centuries have fought a good fight in Ireland in the cause of
civilisation and religious truth . . . where . . . though
surrounded with difficulties of every kind, they have maintained
their ground; amidst darkness they have held up a lamp, and it
would be well for Ireland were all her children like these, her
adopted ones.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is highly controversial ground,
upon which there is no need to enter, save for the purpose of
remarking that the man who had recently written that was like to
be a friendly soul to Berkeley.&nbsp; And during his stay in
Cornwall he was frequently at the vicarage.&nbsp; He would, as
Berkeley related to Dr. Knapp in the character-sketch he
reproduces, &ldquo;suddenly spring from his seat and walk to and
fro the room in silence; anon he would clap his hands and sing a
gypsy song, or perchance would chant forth a translation of some
Viking poem; after which he would sit down again and chat about
his father, whose memory he revered, as he did his
mother&rsquo;s.&rdquo; <a name="citation154"></a><a
href="#footnote154" class="citation">[154]</a>&nbsp; He had the
&ldquo;Horrors&rdquo; <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>more than once.&nbsp; He told
Berkeley that these attacks of depression were the result of the
attempt made by a gypsy crone to poison him, as related in
&ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; The vicar and his wife visited
Penquite one evening, and found Borrow sitting, sunk in despair,
by the side of a huge fire, taking no notice of person or
thing.&nbsp; He remained wrapped in his mood of melancholy for
hours, and was only roused from it when Mrs. Berkeley sat down at
the piano and softly played some old Scots and Irish airs.&nbsp;
Then, after a while, he jumped up and danced about the room, and
began to shout a joyous melody.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Horrors&rdquo;
had been conjured away, and he was another man.&nbsp; He made up
for his previous obsession by giving the company liberally of his
best, pouring out good stories and side-splitting anecdotes as
fast as he could recite them.&nbsp; And, as Mrs. Berkeley was
leaving the room, he said to her, &ldquo;Your music was as
David&rsquo;s harp to my soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the sources of Borrow&rsquo;s pride in his father was
his long and loyal service as a soldier; he had no respect for
people who beat the sword into a ploughshare.&nbsp; Berkeley
records his retort upon a young man who was telling how he had
retired from the army because &ldquo;the army
was&mdash;aw&mdash;no place for a gentleman now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should judge,&rdquo; said Borrow, &ldquo;that it was
rather the other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>&ldquo;What do I mean?&nbsp; Why, this: that the army
is no place for a man who is not a gentleman, and that such a
person was right in leaving it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow was fortunate, apparently, in the occasions of some of
these Johnsonian fulminations.&nbsp; It is not everybody who
would endure the treatment so mildly as did the ex-army officer,
or that latitudinarian don who is reported once to have met
Borrow at Dr. Hake&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; The pundit preached at
Borrow for some time, so runs the tale, and, when he had
finished, Borrow thumped the table with his fist, crying,
&ldquo;Sir, you&rsquo;re a fool!&rdquo;&nbsp; As <i>Punch</i>
very justly remarked about this prodigious narrative, because the
article in which it appeared was in praise of Borrow,
Borrow&rsquo;s rudeness was made to appear to be &ldquo;the end
of the don for ever . . . there was no appeal.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet
the don probably had a case, and if the article had been in
praise of him, Borrow would certainly have been made to appear
the fool.&nbsp; He has suffered not a little from the
ill-regulated enthusiasm of admirers who insist on counting his
petulance and his outbursts of boorishness as his minor virtues
instead of his major vices.</p>
<p>A quaint commentary on anecdotes of this sort is
Berkeley&rsquo;s assertion that Borrow often repeated to him the
answer he received from an old prize-fighter in reply to the
question, &ldquo;What is the best way to get through life
quietly?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Learn to box, and keep <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>a civil
tongue in your head.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely the most illuminating
example of pure precept without example that can be unearthed in
all literature.&nbsp; Berkeley shared the common fate of
Borrow&rsquo;s associates who supposed that a successful writer
would care to discuss other writers.&nbsp; The genial vicar found
how good a hater his visitor was; he displayed his spleen against
the Martineaus; he foamed over the inoffensive Mrs. Stowe.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin&rdquo; was then the fashion, and
Berkeley sang its praises.&nbsp; Borrow showed great excitement,
and presently exploded invective against &ldquo;a lot of Uncle
Toms and Tomfools!&rdquo;&nbsp; When he cooled down he had the
grace to apologise for his vehemence.</p>
<p>But in all this intercourse with the lively Orangeman, of
course, Borrow is to be seen only on one side, and that not the
best, of his many-sided character.&nbsp; It was his controversial
side.&nbsp; Berkeley, not native, had little intimate knowledge
of Cornwall.&nbsp; Just one fact appears in his reminiscences
which may fitly bridge the gulf between these episodes and
Borrow&rsquo;s real adventures.&nbsp; He liked to pore over the
register of St. Cleer Church, where the names of so many Borrows
were inscribed, and one day was sent into transports of delight
by the discovery of a marriage record in which the woman&rsquo;s
name was Jenefer&mdash;a name commoner in Cornwall aforetime than
at present.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you not see?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is Guinevere, King Arthur&rsquo;s wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>Borrow, who wrote that fine passage about Stonehenge,
which has been already quoted (p. <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page54">54</a></span>), who waited for sunrise over that
silent plain under the portal of giants, could not fail to be
fascinated by the arch&aelig;ological riches of his
father&rsquo;s native place.&nbsp; Particularly was he entranced
by the Trevethy Stone&mdash;alternatively
&ldquo;Trethevy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Few parishes in the kingdom can
boast a prehistoric structure of so elaborate a kind as this huge
cromlech, few parish roads so great a store of relics of bygone
art and ancient piety as the mile or so of parish road that
Borrow traversed in order to reach it.&nbsp; It is at once the
finest and the least-known cromlech in the West of England, and
in a splendid state of preservation.&nbsp; The walls are four
huge slabs of granite, only one of which has departed from the
perpendicular; the roof is a fifth huge slab, in one corner of
which is a round hole that has formed the theme of many a heated
arch&aelig;ological discussion.&nbsp; If, as is supposed, the
ancients (who without the assistance of machinery dealt with such
enormous weights as these) first constructed great earthworks,
and then pulled the rocks into position by rolling them up the
slopes upon the trunks of fir-trees, the hole may have been used
for the attachment of the ropes upon which the army of workmen
hauled.&nbsp; Or the hole may be the work of weather, which has
wrought such pixy-pranks in granite, as may be observed in the
Devil&rsquo;s Cheesewring not far off.&nbsp; The Trethevy
cromlech must have been the memorial, and <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>probably
the burial-place, of some great chieftain.&nbsp; Whatever the
grave or the cairn contained, it was, like all the other
monuments of the kind, rifled ages ago, and nothing but the
silent stones is left.</p>
<p>Borrow says of his sensations when he saw it, &ldquo;A thrill
came over me as I surveyed this gigantic erection.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He does not tell us what his speculations were as to the origin
of the hole; but after he had climbed to the top and carefully
measured every stone, he put his arm through the hole, and
shouted, &ldquo;Success to Old Cornwall!&rdquo;&nbsp; He spares
us the obvious comparison between the Eleusinian Mysteries and
the rites of the M&ecirc;n-an-tol, or holed stone, administered
to Druidic neophytes.</p>
<p>From Penquite it was not a far cry, for a man who walked five
miles in an hour with ease, to the great brown-backed hill of
Caradon, seamed all along its foot with the wounds inflicted by
centuries of miners.&nbsp; Caradon is twelve hundred feet high,
and gives a wonderful prospect over two counties.&nbsp; From its
summit, on a clear day, the Atlantic to the North and the Channel
to the South are the limits of vision.&nbsp; Across the narrow
gorge intervening strode the hat-less pedestrian of
six-feet-three, looking like some nineteenth-century giant
Caradon swallowing up the miles of bracken and heath, to the
round hill where the Devil&rsquo;s Cheesewring was piled,
examining with curiosity, just below the peak, the hut of one
Daniel Gumb.&nbsp; Gumb was no gnome, no pixy, no mythical <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>person, as
his name might almost betoken, but a veritable person in the
flesh, stonemason and mathematician, who had carved in the block
of granite that formed the roof of his dwelling-place a problem
of Euclid.&nbsp; There are the squares and triangles remaining to
this day to attest both his scholarship and his craft.&nbsp; On a
heath near by, Borrow was shown three stone circles which carried
his mind back three thousand years at least (Sir Norman Lockyer
may be able to say how much more), &ldquo;the
Hurlers&rdquo;&mdash;according to quaint tradition the petrified
bodies of groups of profane persons who played the ancient
Cornish game of hurling on a Sunday.&nbsp; There is one stone
pillar a little distance to the south of the circles, which is
said to have been the messenger who was going to St. Cleer for
ale when the sudden petrifaction took place.&nbsp; This looks,
however, like an excrescence of modern humour, probably conceived
by a foreigner, since natives would joke with reluctance on such
a subject.&nbsp; Sunday is a golfless day in Cornwall even
now.&nbsp; Another and a less ribald version of the story was
given to Borrow at Woolston.&nbsp; It related that while the
hurlers were gathered where the three circles now are, on Cradock
Moor there was a giant, who held in his hand a golden ball, which
he was to throw over the tower of St. Cleer Church, and the first
of the hurlers to find it was to possess it.&nbsp; The giant
shared the fate of the other Sabbath-breakers, and is to be seen
to this day <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>on the moor in the form of &ldquo;The
Longstone&rdquo;&mdash;an old round-headed cross.</p>
<p>A few miles in upon the moor to the north, Borrow twice
visited the very heart and centre of Cornish romance&mdash;the
lonely mountain pool of Dozmary.&nbsp; Set high among the wild,
uncultivated hills, the pool breathes mystery.&nbsp; It is
hundreds of feet above the river that winds down the combes:
whence comes the water?&nbsp; The love of magical solutions for
natural conundrums is deep-rooted.&nbsp; Colloquial opinion has
held the pool in awe, reported it fathomless; and at the present
day, to explain a lake at the top of a hill, with no visible
intake of water, by saying it is fed from the inexhaustible
reservoir of the peat in the surrounding country, is not held by
some people to be facing the question adequately.&nbsp; But the
spiritual and legendary mysteries of Dozmary were far more
attractive to Borrow.&nbsp; It is reputed to be the original
setting of two of the great legends of the world&mdash;the
Passing of Arthur, and the Penance of Tregeagle.</p>
<p>Standing on the silver strand that belts the lake, on a
moonlit night of such winter weather as Borrow found in the
hills, it is easy to reconstruct the ritual of the Mort
d&rsquo;Arthur, either on the lines of Malory or those of
Tennyson, to erect stately scenes and silent processionals, to
enact the temptation of Bedivere, to select the clump of flags in
which he hid the brand Excalibur, to see his three journeys to
the shore, and <a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>finally to watch the whirling and flashing of the blade
as it left his hand and curved over the water, where rose that
arm</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Clothed in white samite, mystic,
wonderful,<br />
And caught him by the hilt, and brandished him<br />
Three times, and drew him under in the mere.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is easy to imagine the last scene of all&mdash;Arthur
coming</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he
walked,<br />
Larger than human on the frozen hills,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the funeral barge appearing on the waters, bearing the three
queens, the commencement of the voyage into the unknown, to the
island valley of Avalon.&nbsp; By the cold moonlight the
spectacle fits the frame, for all distances are magnified and the
awkward corners of daylight fact are obscured by the mysterious
glamour.&nbsp; It is not the setting Tennyson has given to the
Idyll, but it mates the story as told by Malory in his
re-rendering from the French.&nbsp; It is not far over the hills
to Slaughter Bridge, where Arthur is said to have received his
mortal wound in combat with Sir Mordred; it is a dozen miles or
so to King Arthur&rsquo;s Castle at Tintagel.</p>
<p>Fascinating as the great allegory is in any setting, it may be
assumed, quite safely, that Borrow was even more keenly
interested in the other, wilder, fiercer legend of
Dozmary&mdash;the legend of Tregeagle.&nbsp; For, though he
exclaimed his pleasure at detecting a resemblance between the
names Jenefer and Guinevere <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>in the parish records of St. Cleer,
and afterwards made a journey to the Arthurian country to the
north&mdash;when he passed by Caerleon on his tour through Wales,
he did not turn aside to dream of the Round Table, but contented
himself with mentioning Caerleon as &ldquo;at one time one of the
most considerable towns in Britain,&rdquo; and went on to explain
that whisky really was a corruption of the Erse word for water,
and that meticulous accuracy would describe the fiery spirit as
usquebaugh!</p>
<p>The Penance of Tregeagle was a very different matter.&nbsp; It
is a variant of the universal Satanic legend.&nbsp; Tregeagle is
a prototype of the immemorial man who makes compact with the
Father of Evil, the bargain in this case being a hundred years of
earthly pleasure in return for his soul immortal.&nbsp; The
parable is an answer to the tragic question, &ldquo;What shall it
profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own
soul?&rdquo;&nbsp; Tregeagle was a shepherd, who, dissatisfied
with his share of the good things of earth, expressed a petulant
wish to possess all he could see.&nbsp; The Devil appeared to him
in guise of Knight, arrayed in black armour, carrying a black
lance, riding a black horse, accompanied by two black hounds of
hell.&nbsp; The stranger challenged Tregeagle&rsquo;s desire; for
the forfeit of his soul at the end of a hundred years, he should
have during those hundred years a castle and broad lands and
endless riches.&nbsp; The shepherd accepted the terms; the Black
<a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>Knight
sounded his terrible horn and rode away, with the black hounds
(which dominate the story in all its versions) snarling at his
horse&rsquo;s heels.&nbsp; In some form or other the dog is
nearly always associated with the Satanic legend.&nbsp; In the
Faust stories the Spirit of Evil is introduced as a dog.&nbsp; In
&ldquo;Tam o&rsquo; Shanter,&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There sat Auld Nick in shape o&rsquo;
beast,<br />
A towzie tyke, black, grim, and large.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon the Devil&rsquo;s departure, Tregeagle fell into a
trance, and, when he awoke, the moors were changed into waving
forests and verdant meadows, and on the hill where Dozmary had
been stood a splendid castle.&nbsp; Tregeagle himself was arrayed
in knightly costume, and saluted as their lord by a stately
retinue.</p>
<p>In the course of his hundred years of prosperity all his fine
stock of original sin had black and bloody development.&nbsp;
Rapine, murder, and pillage went unchecked; he consummated his
crimes by abducting the lovely virgin Goonhylda, daughter of the
Earl of Cornwall, and shutting her up in the castle.&nbsp; Her
father led an expedition to rescue her, and its arrival at
Tregeagle&rsquo;s gates precisely coincided with the expiration
of his hundred years.&nbsp; And as the Earl&rsquo;s messenger
thundered there, the sound of the terrible horn and the sinister
baying of hounds was heard; the Black Horseman came riding across
the hills, calling upon Tregeagle to surrender himself, for that
his bond was due.</p>
<p><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>Tregeagle, in a palsy of fear, stepped out, and was
immediately stricken dead by a bolt from the black clouds that
had suddenly o&rsquo;erspread the scene.&nbsp; A storm raged, a
spectre arose from the corpse of Tregeagle and fled into the
murk, pursued by the grim huntsman and his hounds.&nbsp; When the
storm had passed, the enchantment was over.&nbsp; Castle, forests
and meadows had vanished; once more stretched the wide brown
moors, glittered the surface of the pool.&nbsp; But Tregeagle was
condemned for ever to the service of the Devil, who delights to
set him Sisyphean tasks, of which the chief is to drain dry the
pool of Dozmary by baling it with a limpet shell which has a hole
in the bottom.&nbsp; Let him desist for a moment, and his torture
begins; he flies shrieking before the Huntsman and his ghastly
hounds.&nbsp; The spectre horseman and his pack are known as
&ldquo;The Devil and his Durdy Dogs.&rdquo;&nbsp; The punishment
of Tregeagle is only a small part of their business.&nbsp; They
travel far and wide, not only over the moors but along the sea
coasts, and their attentions are most fatal to those who happen
to be abroad at night bent on deeds of evil.&nbsp; There is a
tale of a herdsman who was on the moor of a winter&rsquo;s night,
and was chased by the Durdy Dogs, which came rushing down from a
neighbouring tor.&nbsp; He could not run fast enough to escape,
and just as they were close upon him he fell on his knees in
prayer.&nbsp; Immediately the dogs stood at bay, howling
ferociously.&nbsp; The terrible Huntsman <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>shouted,
&ldquo;Bo Shrove!&rdquo; (&ldquo;the boy prays&rdquo;), and at
the word both he and his hounds vanished. <a
name="citation166"></a><a href="#footnote166"
class="citation">[166]</a>&nbsp; Similar legends of the
yeth-hounds of Dartmoor are heard in Devonshire.&nbsp; As the
black dogs hunt Tregeagle across the Cornish hills, their baying
and his cries of agony are heard in lonely cottages at
night.&nbsp; One draws closer to the chimney-corner as the wind
pelts moaning athwart the waste, when this tradition is related
to him by firelight in one of the crofts near by.&nbsp; Crying
children are told that they are &ldquo;roarin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
howlin&rsquo; like Tregeagle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow was deeply interested, not only in these larger legends
of world-celebrity, but in the purely local folklore, the pixy
stories of the peasantry.&nbsp; The Cornish pixies&mdash;or
&ldquo;piskies,&rdquo; to use the vernacular&mdash;are diminutive
fairies, generally dressed in green, very fond of mirth and
mischief, some bad, but most good.&nbsp; They mislead men at
night, for fun; then the only way to break the spell is for the
victim to turn his coat inside out.&nbsp; They play practical
jokes; they resemble, now Will o&rsquo; the Wisp, now the
Scottish brownie, and again Robin Goodfellow; when properly
propitiated they sometimes make gifts to their human neighbours
of fairy food and fairy goblets.&nbsp; Borrow heard how the
pixies mount horses&rsquo; heads at nights, and ride them about
the fields, making stirrups of their manes; how they work in the
mines, and are heard knocking in the levels underground, like the
<a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>Duegars
of northern latitudes; how some of them are under penance, like
Tregeagle, to bale dry the pool of Dozmary.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Borrow, his cousin, related this characteristic
story to him.&nbsp; A child belonging to poor parents was
observed to have developed peculiarities.&nbsp; Among these was
the fact that it could never get enough to eat.&nbsp; This is
not, one might suppose, a peculiarity of children altogether
confined to St. Cleer or even to Cornwall; but this child&rsquo;s
appetite was so abnormal that its relations decided to consult a
wise woman about it.&nbsp; The witch told them that she had no
doubt it was a pisky.&nbsp; She recommended them to put a large
quantity of old shoes on a spit and make the child turn it, even
if they had to beat it to compel it to the task.&nbsp; This
procedure was adopted, and after a sound thrashing and much
complaining the child was heard to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am four score years and more,<br />
But never saw such a roast before.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, as they were too young to have a child over eighty, the
parents had proof positive that it was a pisky.&nbsp; The murder
being out, after some time it disappeared, and their own child
was magically restored to them.</p>
<h2><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A GALLANT GIRL AND HER FAMILY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The</span> Pollards,&rdquo; praised
as a &ldquo;very fine family&rdquo; in Borrow&rsquo;s notebooks,
lived at Woolston, in the neighbouring parish of St. Ive.&nbsp;
He told them they reminded him of Spaniards.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
gallant girl&rdquo; of eighteen, who rode with him over the
countryside, Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s daughter, afterwards married Mr.
Edward Pollard, and came into possession of Penquite.&nbsp; Miss
Taylor was a notorious horsewoman.&nbsp; She owned at one time a
very spirited horse, on which she used to ride every Sunday to
church at St. Cleer.&nbsp; There was no mounting that horse in
the ordinary way, and she invariably got into the saddle with one
leap.&nbsp; Outside the church gate there would always be a crowd
of people assembled to</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;See the young lady<br />
Get up on her horse&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when she started home for Penquite.&nbsp; Of that family
circle round William Pollard, who was head of the house at
Woolston during Borrow&rsquo;s visit, alternately amazed,
bewildered, and enchanted by the visitor, two sons and two
daughters still survive. <a name="citation168"></a><a
href="#footnote168" class="citation">[168]</a>&nbsp; A charming
<a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>lady of
great age, the daughter, has clear recollections of the events of
half a century ago.&nbsp; Her impression of &ldquo;the walking
lord of gypsy-lore,&rdquo; as Dr. Hake called him, is of &ldquo;a
very tall, silvery-headed man of middle age, with wonderful brown
eyes, remarkably handsome and well-knit.&nbsp; He seemed to know
something about everything.&nbsp; The fact we marvelled at was
that, being acquainted with so many languages, he did not
confound one with another.&nbsp; He appeared to be a wild,
romantic person, a being of whom we had never seen the like
before; his energy was unbounded&mdash;he almost lived in the
open air, though it was in the depth of a bitter
winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has already been indicated that the winter of 1853&ndash;4
was unusually severe&mdash;at any rate for Cornwall, where the
climate is generally as soft as that of Ireland.&nbsp; The hills
and tors ascending to the north of the country in which Borrow
was staying were mantled in white during the greater part of his
visit.&nbsp; The clear air at these altitudes seemed to inspirit
him; he was a very different person from the Borrow who had
nursed his grievances and been tormented by his melancholy demons
on the marshes of Oulton.&nbsp; &ldquo;One morning,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Edey, &ldquo;after an exceptionally heavy fall of snow
during the night, he was up with the earliest light, ploughing
his way through the drifts to Woolston, where he commandeered one
of my brothers to be his companion for a whole-day ramble over
the snow-bound moors.&nbsp; And, <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>said my brother, he sang as he
walked the songs of half-a-dozen nations from the time they left
almost without interruption, till they returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are two interesting passages in her story throwing a
sidelight upon his relations with children.&nbsp; On his frequent
walks from Penquite to Woolston he was wont to pass a certain
desolate, abandoned mine.&nbsp; On the side of its premises was a
little rough stone building, occupied as a cottage by a poor
woman with a large family.&nbsp; The children&rsquo;s
poverty-stricken condition attracted his notice, and he regularly
took with him in his pocket some bit of food to present to them
as they stood looking out for the arrival of the tall stranger
with the white hair.&nbsp; One of the children was customarily
posted on the roadside to watch for him, and this one was dubbed
by Borrow &ldquo;the little sentinel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, at
dinner with some legal light of the district, he was suddenly
missed during dessert, and a search revealed him in a remote room
surrounded by the children of the house, whom he was amusing by
his stories and catechising in the subjects of their studies and
pursuits.&nbsp; He excused his absence by saying that he had been
fascinated by the intelligence of the children, and had forgotten
all about the dinner.&nbsp; More than once he expressed a high
opinion of the mental average of Cornish children.</p>
<p>Penquite, the &ldquo;substantial stone house on a
hillside,&rdquo; where Borrow stayed with Mr. and Mrs. Robert
Taylor in 1854, is a characteristic Cornish farmhouse <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>of the
older and better sort&mdash;the native home of yeomen.&nbsp; The
parish road ascends a steep hillock in the direct and
uncompromising manner which is the distinctive mark of an old
way, beaten out before the era of enclosure and before the
development of wheeled traffic.&nbsp; At the top a thicket of
pine and beech trees stands sentinel beside the
&ldquo;court-gate,&rdquo; beyond which the road, curling to the
south, brings one to a view of orchard land speckled with
snowdrops, white gates, cedars of rich green, a slated house,
French windows gleaming in the sun, and a garden sloping towards
the stream at the bottom of the valley.</p>
<p>This was the destination to which Shorsha, the horse-wizard,
and Robert Taylor, the Cornish farmer, cantered up on Christmas
Eve of 1853.&nbsp; The Taylors left it in 1877, handing the farm
on to Edward Pollard, who had married their only daughter.&nbsp;
At Mrs. Pollard&rsquo;s death (1904), the property passed into
the hands of her eldest son, Edward.&nbsp; It was this eldest son
who answered my pull at the bell-knob under the ancient granite
porch, and gave me a real welcome.&nbsp; He has added a section
to the house at the back, but the southern front remains as it
has been for many generations.&nbsp; Here was the old low-ceiled
parlour where Borrow and Berkeley, the Irish vicar, discussed the
comparative beauty and virtue of Cornish women and Irish women;
beyond, the stone-flagged kitchen where he got his
&ldquo;hospitable reception, with a log on <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>the
fire.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the march of science has partly spoilt the
venerable kitchen.&nbsp; It has left the settle from which
Shorsha&rsquo;s long legs stretched to the blaze, but it has
filled up the open hearth and put a modern kitchen range in its
place.&nbsp; Mr. William Pollard is the son of one of that
&ldquo;fine family&rdquo; at Woolston with whom Borrow discoursed
of Australia, whence two of the young Pollards had just returned
that Christmas.&nbsp; In the early &rsquo;fifties Australia was a
name to conjure with; Ballarat was a magic incantation.&nbsp; Two
of the five Pollard sons adventured there, and it was one of the
two that I visited Woolston to see.</p>
<p>Mr. Pollard, in his ninetieth year, was a prisoner in a
canopied bed, but with a mind clear and logical, and full of
memories and interests.&nbsp; Scattered around him were
newspapers and books, and one of the books a contemporary of
Borrow himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;A very strange, wild person,&rdquo;
was his introductory description of Borrow; &ldquo;a very tall,
upstanding man, wiry and lithe, with a strong face and snow-white
hair.&nbsp; He looked fit for anything, and I believe he
was&mdash;that he feared no man nor devil.&nbsp; I remember the
first evening he came here.&nbsp; We had tea in the parlour, and,
farmhouse fashion, we had some roast beef on the table, which my
father carved.&nbsp; After tea, somebody suggested that he should
sing a song.&nbsp; He did sing it, and a weird, wailing,
outlandish song it was.&nbsp; No&mdash;not a gypsy song. . .
.&nbsp; Maybe it was the song of Swayne Vonved.&nbsp; He got up
<a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>and
waved his arms as he sang of his hero&rsquo;s adventures, he
fought an imaginary foe, and finally, as he worked himself into a
fervour of passionate song, he seized the carving-knife from the
table and swished it round his head.&nbsp; We all drew back, and
some of us were glad when the song was over and he dropped that
carving-knife and sat down.&nbsp; His voice was
tremendous&mdash;&lsquo;as big as Tregeagle&rsquo;s,&rsquo; as we
say in Cornwall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only the legendary lore and the ancient language of
Cornwall interested Borrow; he was equally attracted by the
physical characteristics of the peninsula, and impressed by the
great wealth lying dormant in the incalculable masses of granite
on the moors.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I were a rich man,&rdquo; he
exclaimed, &ldquo;I would buy up all this granite; it will be
wanted one day.&rdquo;&nbsp; The demand for Cornish granite in
various great public works and the present activity of the
quarries at the Cheesewring illustrate his foresight.</p>
<p>The Woolston people were particularly struck by Borrow&rsquo;s
intense enthusiasm for the legend and the poetry of the
North.&nbsp; He himself relates how, on a walking tour farther
west, he faced eight dreary miles on a rainy evening, solacing
himself by singing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Look out, look out, Swayne
Vonved!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the Danish ballad he had translated more than thirty years
before.&nbsp; At Woolston he made the Vikings live again for
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;He gave us Odin and Thor without
ceasing.&rdquo;&nbsp; There never could have been so <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>much Norse
mythology in that part of Cornwall before.&nbsp; Some of the
ladies seem to have fallen in love with his hair, but could not
summon up courage to beg a lock; and one of them saved his
combings and preserved them in tissue-paper for years.</p>
<p>The keen, almost boyish, delight which Borrow took in
everything he saw and heard in the hills, and his complaisance
towards the company he met, are remarkable in the man whose odd
misanthropic fancies and wretched, paltry miseries we have been
watching during many pages.&nbsp; The contrast is vivid
indeed.&nbsp; In Cornwall Borrow was both pleased and
pleasing&mdash;with occasional outbursts such as the display of
spleen against &ldquo;Uncle Tomfools&rdquo;&mdash;whether he were
riding with &ldquo;the gallant girl&rdquo; over the snowy
country, listening to her superstitions about magpies&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One for sorrow, two for mirth;<br />
Three for a wedding, four for death&rdquo; <a
name="citation174a"></a><a href="#footnote174a"
class="citation">[174a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;or visiting patriarchal villagers at Tremar to hear
their stories of pixies and foxes, <a name="citation174b"></a><a
href="#footnote174b" class="citation">[174b]</a> or attending
rural dinner parties, with all the neighbourhood beaten up <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>in his
honour.&nbsp; Some of the pixy stories have been given.&nbsp; The
attitude of the countryside towards the fox in that day was
shockingly unorthodox.&nbsp; He was vermin to be destroyed
whenever and wherever discovered: did he not wreak incalculable
damage in the farmyard by various and subtle devices, such as
taking his brush in his teeth and whirling round like a teetotum
under the poultry perches, till the unhappy fowls, rendered dizzy
by the unaccustomed spectacle, fell an easy prey to his rapacious
appetite?&nbsp; How a fox was shot and the murderer brought his
victim for admiration both of the brush and the deed, is related
without the turning of a hair.&nbsp; The crime was so common as
to be merely a habit; Mr. Baring-Gould, in his story of Parson
Jack Russell, has given a similar account of the ethics of
certain districts in Devonshire about the same period.</p>
<p>Borrow revealed his curiosity and enthusiasm in many
ways.&nbsp; On one occasion a young lady named Every was of the
party at Woolston.&nbsp; Part of the conversation turned&mdash;as
it inevitably would where Borrow was concerned&mdash;on Cornish
names and their derivations.&nbsp; The girl asked him if he could
tell her anything about her name.&nbsp; His mind flew at once to
the one Every or Avery whose career was familiar to him, that
Captain John, of Plymouth, the fierce pirate of the Eastern Seas,
the mortal enemy of John Company, who was reputed to have become
a king in Madagascar&mdash;one of the <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>choicest villains in the history of
the world.&nbsp; &ldquo;I said that the most celebrated person
who ever bore it was a buccaneer, whereupon she informed me that
her grandmother had told her that she was descended from a famous
pirate.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he adds the suggestive commentary,
&ldquo;Very pleasant party!&rdquo; <a name="citation176"></a><a
href="#footnote176" class="citation">[176]</a></p>
<p>One of the most interesting gatherings arranged for him, of
course, was the family dinner party at the old farmhouse of
Tredinnick, where his father was born.&nbsp; According to
Berkeley, who was among the guests, nearly all the Borrows of the
district were present, and George was highly excited, with his
mind constantly running upon the father whom he had
worshipped.&nbsp; The circumstances of the feast and the memories
it aroused were too much for him; he ceased to be merry and
talkative, and closed up his store of song and story; instead of
exerting himself to amuse his friends, he sat with restless
glance wandering <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>around the rooms in which old Captain Tom had spent his
boyhood; his eyes were moist.&nbsp; Suddenly he left the party
and burst into the open air&mdash;meeting with an ugly tumble
over a low wall into the yard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he
to Berkeley as they parted for the night, &ldquo;we have shared
the old-fashioned hospitality of old-fashioned people in an
old-fashioned house.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was overwrought to an
extraordinary extent, and the excitement, together with the shock
of his little accident, brought on an indisposition that kept him
laid up all next day.</p>
<p>Having been a little more than a fortnight at Penquite, he
began his walking tour through Cornwall to the extreme
west.&nbsp; At Mousehole, not far from the Land&rsquo;s End,
lived one Burney, an officer of the coastguard, who was a distant
connection of the family.&nbsp; Taylor had given Borrow a letter
of introduction to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can only see Cornwall or
know anything about it by walking through it,&rdquo; he wrote to
his wife.&nbsp; The secrets of Cornwall, the conditions of its
detachment, the spell of its romance, can only be penetrated by
the man who &ldquo;the known track . . . deserts, and has a
by-way of his own.&rdquo;&nbsp; He must explore its hills and
combes, and its remoter villages for their arch&aelig;ological
treasures&mdash;whether of the prehistoric races who have left
their mark upon its sad grey stones, or of the saints and heroes
of the early Christian time, or of the authors and the actors of
its Mystery Plays&mdash;and he must know the simple <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>folk of its
ancient blood to probe the riches of their lore.&nbsp; Even
Borrow hardly turned far enough aside from the beaten paths to
get more than a very general impression of the country; but he
was a man who observed readily and absorbed eagerly.</p>
<p>Nicholas Borrow, his cousin, was his topographical mentor and
guide on many expeditions, and, now that he was leaving for the
West, accompanied him on horseback across country to set him in
the main road.&nbsp; He saw Tremewth, where his father&rsquo;s
comrade, Thomas Honey, lived on the top of the hill, and the
field near Redgate containing the grave of King Doniert (or
Dungerth), the lord of the Western Britons in the ninth century,
with its broken pillar and Latin inscription.&nbsp; Parting with
his cousin, he walked on to Lostwithiel, the end of his first
day&rsquo;s journey, took his ease in the Talbot Inn, and feasted
on roast fowl and bacon.&nbsp; The ancient stannary town, with
its shire hall dating from the thirteenth century, and its
memories of the Civil War&mdash;when Essex stabled his horses in
the church, and his troopers brought a horse to the font and with
a mock baptism sardonically gave it the name of
Charles&mdash;produced mingled emotions in Borrow&rsquo;s mind,
for, in spite of his militant Protestantism, he was a staunch
Tory and a Royalist.&nbsp; Turning aside to see the hoary Castle
of Restormel, which had been a ruin since the time of Edward the
Third, he recorded some vivid impressions of the neighbourhood as
&ldquo;the most beautiful he ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>They
will not appear exaggerated to those who have approached it as
Borrow did through the wonderful Glyn Valley, by the road which
follows the river brawling down from its moorland birthplace
towards the sea at Fowey.&nbsp; The second day he covered
twenty-four miles to Truro.&nbsp; The sight of a cairn on a hill
top &ldquo;brought the Spirit of Old upon my mind.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<i>Antiquis debetur reverentia</i> was always a potent principle
with Borrow; nevertheless, the modern Protestant within him
sometimes got the better of the antiquary.&nbsp; On the previous
day he had seen a cross, and examined it.&nbsp; This monument
&ldquo;seemed to have been raised by some Puseyite.&nbsp; The
base contained a nonsensical inscription to the effect that it
had been erected on a place which had been devoted to
&lsquo;Druidic Idolatry.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Druids were no
idolaters, though the Papists are.&rdquo; <a
name="citation179"></a><a href="#footnote179"
class="citation">[179]</a>&nbsp; It was darkening to evening when
he passed through Grampound, one of the minute derelict boroughs
of Cornwall, whose disfranchisement in 1821 was the one and only
result of Lord John Russell&rsquo;s first agitation against
electoral corruption.&nbsp; The appearance of The Dolphin Inn,
looking snug with its lighted windows and air of warmth and
comfort, was a strong invitation to a tired wayfarer who had more
often than most men</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . . by care oppressed<br />
Found in an inn a place of rest.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>He
looked wistfully at it, but withstood the temptation (with the
assistance of Swayne Vonved), and pushed on through the rainy
night to Truro, and to dinner and bed at the Royal Hotel.</p>
<p>In the morning he inspected the town, and visited the
church&mdash;which no longer exists save as a fragment built into
the northern side of Benson&rsquo;s great cathedral&mdash;and
then started again for the West.&nbsp; His walk extended no
farther than ten miles that day.&nbsp; On his arrival at Redruth,
one of the centres of the mining district, he was arrested by the
great hill of Carn Brea, to the north-west of the town.&nbsp; Its
noble summit is one of the most striking features of the
landscape viewed from any part of West Cornwall, and it is the
haunt of many legends&mdash;mostly unauthentic and nearly all
ridiculous.&nbsp; The entertaining old Borlase, in his
&ldquo;Antiquities of Cornwall,&rdquo; invented a grotesque set
of theories about the origin of the curiously-shaped rocks that
strew the long length of the hill&rsquo;s crest.&nbsp; Borlase
saw Druids everywhere, and Druidical sculpture in every freak
Nature had played through countless centuries with the granite
which she found so pliable.&nbsp; It was inconceivable in his
time that the &ldquo;basins&rdquo; and channels in the rocks of
Carn Brea could have been merely the result of
&ldquo;weathering,&rdquo; as the geologists inform us now they
must have been.&nbsp; &ldquo;In yonder grave a Druid lies&rdquo;
was predicated by Borlase of every mound he saw.&nbsp; One
perceives that Borrow adopted all his theories <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>without
modification.&nbsp; On Carn Brea he was not merely on a
magnificent precipitous hill, with a wide-stretching view away to
the Atlantic on the north; he was in the midst of a thousand
memories of the past; the &ldquo;Spirit of Old&rdquo; came upon
him again; white-robed priests defiled along the heather, and
performed their sacrificial rites upon the granite altars.&nbsp;
The notes he made about Carn Brea were, says he, &ldquo;written
on the top of the sacrificial rock.&nbsp; In the upper basin, the
horrid place of sacrifice, there are outlets for the blood to
stream down.&nbsp; There seem to be about eight basins in
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; William Borlase himself could have accomplished
nothing better than that.</p>
<p>On January 12th he set off from Redruth towards Penzance in
torrents of rain.&nbsp; Just above Rosewarne he came across a
gypsy caravan, and of necessity must go to find its inhabitants
and talk with them.&nbsp; A dark woman addressed him; he asked
her her name in Romany.&nbsp; She pretended at first not to
understand, but finally answered him.&nbsp; Presently her
husband, &ldquo;a remarkably knavish-looking personage,&rdquo;
put out his head and began to discourse with him.&nbsp; He told
him that their name was Bosvile.&nbsp; It will be remembered that
the &ldquo;Flaming Tinman&rdquo; of Mumper&rsquo;s Dingle was
called Bosvile.&nbsp; The Bosviles, or Boswells, as they were
called in later days, were, in fact, a well-known tribe of
gypsies in the West of England.&nbsp; Another family, real
Cornish in all their <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>associations, formed a branch of the
ubiquitous Smiths.&nbsp; In 1866 they departed from England
almost in a body for America, where most of the Stanleys and the
Coopers had already gone.</p>
<p>While talking with Bosvile and his mort, Borrow heard the
sound of fiddles in an adjoining tent, and was invited to join
the company, for doubtless his perfect knowledge of the language
and his unfailing fascination over the gypsies had overcome all
their first suspicions; but he told them that he was
&ldquo;mokhado&rdquo; (muddy and dirty), gave them a four-penny
piece, and departed.&nbsp; He went through Hayle, then, and now,
one of the Cornish homes of industry, which he contemptuously
dismisses as &ldquo;a filthy place.&rdquo;&nbsp; Reaching
Penzance in the evening, he dined at the Union Hotel, and held
converse with a mining agent, whom he discovered to be &ldquo;a
sensible man, full of Cornish patriotism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 13th he turned up Mr. Burney at Mousehole, one of the
quaintest fishing villages among the hundred peppered round the
Cornish coast, and found him excellent company.&nbsp; There is
just a glimpse in his memoranda of the kind of miscellany Borrow
might have given to the world if he had ever written his book on
Cornwall&mdash;a mixture of travel and religion, legend and
dialogue, philology and adventure.&nbsp; A page or two would
certainly have been occupied by the story which Burney told him
the first day they met of his doings on the West Coast of
Africa&mdash;many <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>naval officers of the mid-century could relate good
stories of slave-chasing in those regions&mdash;and especially of
the triumphant expedition to the town of a native king, who at
first resisted their demands, his capital being fortified and
defended by thirty guns of sorts.&nbsp; The essence of the tale
was that while the palaver was in progress Burney&rsquo;s gunner
went round and drenched the touch-holes of all the thirty
defending pieces.&nbsp; Borrow returned to Penzance that night:
again, had the book been written, we should doubtless have been
in possession of the full narrative of the experiences of that
mining agent who had been in Greenland; but he is only just
dotted down, a bare, unclothed lay figure in the surviving
Notes.&nbsp; For the rest of his time in West Penwith, Borrow was
the guest of Mr. Burney, exploring the country of Dolly
Pentreath, who in the eighteenth century had spoken the Cornish
language, and examining the traces there remaining of the Spanish
expedition against the Cornish coasts in 1595.&nbsp; On the
Sunday he went to church at Paul (where Dolly Pentreath was
buried), and in the evening &ldquo;read the Bible and prayers to
the family&rdquo; of Burney.</p>
<p>There was, of course, a trip to St. Michael&rsquo;s Mount, the
show-place of those parts, that castle on an island in
Mount&rsquo;s Bay, which approaches in singularity and beauty, if
it does not quite reach the glory of, its namesake Mont St.
Michel on the coast of Normandy.&nbsp; Borrow went with Burney by
boat from <a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>Mousehole, and observed with curiosity the points of
greatest interest on the island and about the buildings&mdash;the
bastion by which the Parliamentarians were said to have entered
when they attacked the place during the Civil War, the chapel
within the castle, and the stone vault underneath it in which a
skeleton was found.&nbsp; Full of his scheme for the book on
Cornwall, he made his memoranda as he went in order that the
impressions might be quite fresh.&nbsp; Just as he set down old
William Borlase&rsquo;s superstitions &ldquo;on the top of the
sacrificial rock&rdquo; at Carn Brea, so he records that his
notes on St. Michael&rsquo;s Mount were written in the vault.</p>
<p>Borrow returned from the Mount on foot to Mousehole, and two
days later started upon an expedition to the most impressive part
of the Cornish coast&mdash;the Logan Rock and Tol-Pedn-Penwith,
the spot where Charles Wesley is reputed to have written his
famous hymn:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here on a narrow neck of land<br />
&rsquo;Twixt two unbounded seas I stand.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The traveller, however, says very little about the magnificent
scenery, and a great deal about the companion of his
travels.&nbsp; In &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; when Lavengro has
succeeded in divorcing his old friend Murtagh from the
disreputable trade of a thimble-engro, it will be remembered
that, in order to elevate the Irish boy&rsquo;s spirits, he
induces him to tell a story.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Cheer up, man,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
let&rsquo;s have the story, and let it be about Ma-Coul and the
salmon and his thumb.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>But
the tale of the finding of Finn-Ma-Coul in Veintry Bay, his
servitude of Dermod David Odeen, his cooking of the salmon, the
blister on his skin, his discovery of all witchcraft by the
sucking of his thumb, and all the rest of it, was not related to
Lavengro in the &rsquo;twenties by Murtagh at Horncastle
Fair.&nbsp; It was told to him on the Cornish cliff paths by one
Cronan, the Irish guide who was conducting him to the Logan Rock,
as the Notebook shows, and inserted after Borrow got back to
Norfolk to lend the colour of romance to the end of &ldquo;The
Romany Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of Cronan&rsquo;s fairy stories, one is
cited at length&mdash;the tale of the Clog Vreach, or the
parti-coloured stone, under the heading, &ldquo;An Irish Fairy
Tale, told on a Wild Road by a Wild Native.&rdquo; <a
name="citation185"></a><a href="#footnote185"
class="citation">[185]</a>&nbsp; It is a tale of a drunken
blackguard and tyrannical landlord, who vowed that he would shoot
all the fairies to be found on the moor where the Clog Vreach
stood.&nbsp; He went there and fired off all his ammunition, but
when he returned his body was bent, his tongue was hanging out,
and his servants, seeing that he was next door to dead, put him
to bed, and four people poured raw brandy down his throat all
night.&nbsp; After that it is not surprising to learn that in
twenty-four hours his body had turned black and life had left
him.&nbsp; Cronan did not attribute his death to this remarkable
prescription, but rather to the vengeance of the supernatural
powers.&nbsp; &ldquo;And,&rdquo; <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>says he, &ldquo;a very fitting end
it was for a person who was a tyrant and interfered with the
fairies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These things seem to have occupied Borrow on the journey to
the exclusion of all else.&nbsp; Before he left the district,
however, he made some extracts from the register of Paul Church,
recording the death of a Keigwin killed by the Spaniards in 1595,
and the death of Dolly Pentreath (entered in her married name of
Dorothy Jeffery) in 1777.&nbsp; He had hunted up an old man of
eighty at Mousehole, who in his boyhood had seen and heard Dolly
Pentreath, and he had made a long list of Cornish words taken
down from the lips of aged persons in that village.&nbsp; No
doubt the Cornish book was intended to include a vocabulary of
the old tongue.</p>
<p>I do not know of any evidence that Borrow had made a study of
the Cornish language in previous years, but his command of Welsh,
and in a less degree his knowledge of the three variants of
Gaelic, made almost the whole of the Cornish words surviving, in
names of places and people, and in peculiarities of local
dialect, easily understood of him.&nbsp; There is a general
resemblance between Cornish and Welsh about which, I am told, all
writers agree, though they differ as to its exact extent.&nbsp;
But the truth is probably not far from the statement of Sir John
Dodridge, who in 1630 said of the Cornish: &ldquo;They have a
particular language called Cornish (although now much worn out of
use), differing but <a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>little from the Welsh and the
language of the Britaines of France.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Henry
Jenner, F.S.A., in his admirable &ldquo;Handbook of the Cornish
Language,&rdquo; states that Welsh, Cornish, and Breton
&ldquo;may be said to be as near together as three separate
languages can well be, but to have drifted too far apart to be
accounted three dialects of the same language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The principal differences between Cornish and Welsh can be
stated very briefly.&nbsp; The following points show the main
divergences between the Cornish of the later literary remains and
the Welsh of the books and newspapers of the present
day:&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp; Certain grammatical differences, such as the
occasional use of an indefinite article, never employed in
Welsh.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; A number of variations in vocabulary, in
which Cornish will often be found to have used a word current in
contemporary Breton in place of one current in contemporary
Welsh.&nbsp; This is not surprising, even if it be not assumed
that the language was taken into Brittany from England, for the
relations between the shipping ports of Cornwall and Brittany
were exceedingly close, especially those relations of contraband
traffic so dear to the hearts of the writers of romance.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp; Phonetic changes resembling corruptions, such
as the substitution of &ldquo;j&rdquo; or English
&ldquo;ch&rdquo; for &ldquo;d&rdquo; or &ldquo;t&rdquo; in the
bodies or the beginnings of words, and of &ldquo;s&rdquo; or
&ldquo;z&rdquo; for the same letters at the ends of words. <a
name="citation187"></a><a href="#footnote187"
class="citation">[187]</a></p>
<p>It will be seen that Borrow could have found such differences
as these no stumbling-block to his philological excursions.&nbsp;
He would readily recognise <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span><i>Tywardreath</i> as the equivalent
of the Welsh, Tywardraeth, the house on the sands, and would be
assisted thereto by the sight of the wide stretches of white sand
fringing St. Austell Bay in the angle where Tywardreath stands on
its hill side.&nbsp; He would identify <i>Hendra</i> as Hendre,
the old stead; <i>Chyandour</i> as Tyrdwr, the house of the
water; <i>Egloskerry</i> as Eglwyscerrig, the stone church; and
such forms as <i>nance</i> for nant, a ravine, <i>pons</i> for
pont, a bridge, <i>plou</i> for plwyf, a parish, would offer no
difficulty to one familiar with parallel changes in other groups
of languages.</p>
<h2><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE BOOK THAT WAS NOT WRITTEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">By</span> January 26th, 1854, Borrow was
back among his friends at Penquite, bursting in upon them
lyrically with:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Behold the man who&rsquo;s been at Kinmel
Dray,<br />
Who passed by Kinmel Cres upon his way,<br />
And who at Kinmel Worthey made a stay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He and Mr. Taylor undertook a long moorland tramp by tor and
bog that day to Kilmar, a jagged and precipitous hill behind the
Cheesewring, where is the huge rock structure popularly known as
&ldquo;King Arthur&rsquo;s Bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Arthurian mood,
to be developed presently, was already coming upon him.&nbsp;
When, next day, he walked to Liskeard, to visit the ex-Mayor once
more, and met the worthy Town Clerk, the talk turned from
&ldquo;Jew houses&rdquo; to King Arthur&rsquo;s court, and his
imaginative vision darted off to the North and the golden
traditions of glorious Camelot.&nbsp; On these he brooded while
he walked, and while he sat by the roaring fire of hazel faggots
in the kitchen of Penquite.&nbsp; Not that he allowed these
ethereal matters to engross him entirely, for he was curious
about the cost of hazel-wood as fuel&mdash;remembering that he
had burnt it at the shrine of Isopel, <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>the &ldquo;Queen of the
Dingle,&rdquo; thirty years gone.&nbsp; So he notes: &ldquo;Hazel
faggots, 10s. a hundred, at 30 lbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going about among the natives, he disdained no unconsidered
trifle of lore and knowledge.&nbsp; Cornish phrases struck his
fancy, such as &ldquo;bread baked in the clome&rdquo;&mdash;in
earthenware &ldquo;kettles&rdquo; on the open hearth, covered
with burning peat, bread of such a rare flavour and quality,
indeed, as twentieth-century man cannot conceive, even in St.
Cleer, where the &ldquo;machine-baked&rdquo; variety is now
hawked by half a dozen enterprising bakers from the neighbouring
towns.&nbsp; There is another Cornish delicacy which does
persist; it is known as &ldquo;thunder and
lightning&rdquo;&mdash;a <i>soup&ccedil;on</i> of sugar syrup
over the clotted cream of the country.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor old
Philp,&rdquo; he records one of his relatives as narrating among
the characteristics of a local notoriety&mdash;&ldquo;Poor old
Philp used to like &lsquo;triggle&rsquo; over cream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One story given to him by Mr. Taylor was of an old man who
built himself a hovel of turf on Kilmar Tor.&nbsp; In the winter
of 1814 there was a great snow-storm, and the old man&rsquo;s hut
was buried in the drifts for two nights and two days.&nbsp; When
they dug him out they found that he had been in bed all the time,
and declared that it was &ldquo;the longest night I ever knawed;
I thought t&rsquo;d never end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another dinner party at the old house of his
forefathers.&nbsp; He ploughed to Tredinnick <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>through the
drizzle of a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; Cornish day.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ben&rsquo;t got wet, ha&rsquo; thee?&rdquo; was the
salutation of William Borrow, aged seventy, welcoming him to the
homestead.&nbsp; One of his few stumbling-blocks was the Cornish
dialect.&nbsp; &ldquo;My relations are most excellent
people,&rdquo; he wrote to his wife, &ldquo;but I could not
understand more than half of what they said.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
simplicity of their mode of life was a surprise to him, and
probably a pleasant one; he found no affectation of gentility
among them.&nbsp; Wealth to the extent of &pound;70,000 was
reported to be in the united hands of the family, but the head of
it, Henry Borrow, &ldquo;lives in a house in which there is not a
single grate&mdash;nothing but open chimneys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Discussions about the character and attributes of the pixies
were constant.&nbsp; Henry could hardly tell him whether he
believed in the pixies or not; but he did believe in the Durdy
Dogs, having himself heard them giving tongue.&nbsp; If Henry had
confessed to a faith in pixies, he need not have been ashamed of
his intellectual company.&nbsp; The belief was shared by no
smaller a person than the redoubtable Hawker of Morwenstow, who
saw and chased a pixy two years later as he rode through a gorge
on the way home from Wellcombe.&nbsp; He relates how he felt
himself &ldquo;flush and then grow pale&rdquo; when he saw a
&ldquo;brown, rough shape&rdquo; start up among the furze bushes,
and how, &ldquo;remembering St. Thomas&rsquo;s word that every
spirit must crouch to the Sign,&rdquo; he made the sign in <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>the air
before urging his horse towards the creature&mdash;which, of
course, escaped!</p>
<p>Pixies, legends, and philology, however, all took a place in
his keen inquiries secondary to authentic recollections of his
father&rsquo;s youth.&nbsp; He makes full notes of two anecdotes
related to him.&nbsp; Henry Borrow&rsquo;s account of the
Menheniot Fair affray, as the traveller pencilled it down, is
full of delicious filial exultation, which is repeated in another
story, narrated to him by Thomas Borrow, of Lamellion, and thus
set forth:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My father.&mdash;At one time, at Bodmin
Bridge, was a big, bony man six foot high, the terror of
everybody at Plymouth and Devonport.&nbsp; My father fought him
at Liskeard, just by a butcher&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; My father
struck him a blow which sent him staggering across the street
into a cooper&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; He got up and came on again,
saying, &lsquo;Where is Borrow?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Here I
am,&rsquo; said my father, and struck him another blow which
knocked him down, after staggering six yards.&nbsp; He was
dreadfully sick, and did not ask for Borrow again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a pathetic as well as a humorous interest in these
explorations of Cornish memory for traces of the father who had
died in so much doubt as to the future of this son, and so much
well-justified scepticism about the prospect of his maintaining
himself on his &ldquo;Armenian or other acquirements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow became increasingly anxious to see the wild country on
the rock-bound north coast before he left the Duchy for
London.&nbsp; Letters from Mrs. Pollard mention his desire to
inspect &ldquo;King Arthur&rsquo;s Castle at
Tintagell.&rdquo;&nbsp; On February 1st he left Penquite <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>for
Tredinnick, to spend a last day and night with the Borrow family
there, and to brood again over the memories of his father which
the little old house awoke.&nbsp; It was the only night he had
slept at Tredinnick; he had been previously &ldquo;much affected
on being taken upstairs, at the remembrance of his father, and
shed tears.&rdquo;&nbsp; After breakfast the next day he set off
for a rough cross-country ride, mounted on a horse named Triumph,
and accompanied by his cousin, Nicholas Borrow.&nbsp; By way of
the road he had twice traversed with Miss Taylor, past
Doniert&rsquo;s grave, by Redgate, and along the valley of the
lonely Dreynes river, they cantered to Bolventor and the Jamaica
Inn.&nbsp; The derelict village of Bolventor consists at the
present time mainly of a large building set in a square of
grass-grown cobbles&mdash;the erstwhile famous Jamaica Inn.&nbsp;
Now deprived of a licence, and selling mineral waters to casual
and disconsolate wayfarers or thirsty cyclists, this hostelry, at
the time of Borrow&rsquo;s visit, was a place of some
importance&mdash;a coaching house upon the main road between
London and Falmouth.&nbsp; Not many years before it had been busy
day and night with scenes such as those described in the account
of the inn in &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; where Lavengro acted
as hostler and clerk of the stables.&nbsp; The coaches clattered
over the cobble-stones, and the square echoed with the cries of
jarveys and postilions, and the rattle of harness, and the
champing of bits.&nbsp; It was already beginning <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>to decline
in 1854; for the railway was building far to the south, and a new
line of traffic was being opened up.</p>
<p>The two horsemen; now within sight of the greatest hills of
Cornwall, Brown Willy and Rough Tor, left the road and struck
across the heath in the direction of the mountainous northern
horizon.&nbsp; &ldquo;We then proceeded,&rdquo; wrote Borrow,
&ldquo;over moor and moss, till we came to a stream, which we
forded.&nbsp; It was rocky and dangerous.&rdquo;&nbsp; If this
was, as I suppose, Hanter Gantick, the great ravine in which the
Lanke river roars down between banks composed of huge
aggregations of granite boulders, the description was not too
bold.&nbsp; Even in his wildest adventure, he could hardly have
attempted to get a horse across a worse place.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
then ascended another hill, on the top of which we saw at a
distance an inhabited country.&rdquo;&nbsp; The eminence was
probably Rough Tor moor, and the cultivated land the undulating
country to the north of the central wild.&nbsp; Whichever of the
cluster of hills it was, it could not have failed of interest for
Borrow.&nbsp; They provided him with hut circles, with a great
Logan stone encrusted with Druidical superstitions, the court or
&ldquo;hall&rdquo; of King Arthur which he had been discussing at
Liskeard with Mr. Jago, and the remains of a chapel to St.
Michael, whose gate arch was removed some twenty years before to
make a doorway for the Britannia Inn, near Altarnun!&nbsp; Having
seen his cousin through the <a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>wilderness, and pointed out to him
the Pisgah sight of &ldquo;an inhabited country,&rdquo; Nicholas
Borrow bade him an affectionate farewell, and returned with the
horses to Tredinnick, while George set out on foot alone to reach
Camelford.&nbsp; &ldquo;I passed by a place called Carn Long,
and, striding forward, found myself at Camelford before I
expected.&nbsp; A wilder journey over moss and moor I never
made.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;moss,&rdquo; by which he betokens
the bogs in the neighbourhood of Brown Willy, is a notorious
great hindrance to travellers who would otherwise ascend these
hills in much larger numbers.</p>
<p>The extraordinary scenery and the romantic associations of the
country upon which he was now entering amply repaid him for the
toils and pains of his day&rsquo;s scramble across the backbone
of Cornwall.&nbsp; He was in King Arthur&rsquo;s land.&nbsp; At
Camelford he trod a battlefield ten centuries old, for here it
was that Egbert the Saxon met the Britons of the West in
823.&nbsp; Borrow did not linger in the quaint old town, but
pushed on towards Tintagel by way of Slaughter Bridge already
mentioned, which inherited its grisly name from that &ldquo;last
weird battle in the West,&rdquo; where Mordred fell and Arthur
received his mortal hurt.&nbsp; Enthusiastic local authorities,
more confident than the general, are able to give the date of the
conflict as <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 543.&nbsp;
&ldquo;At last I reached Tintagel, about 6.30 p.m., and went to
an inn (the Wharncliffe Arms), kept by Symmonds,&rdquo; to whom
he had been <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>recommended from Penquite.&nbsp; After such a day he
was glad of its shelter and of the creature comforts it offered
to a tired man on a cold February night.</p>
<p>The fascinations of Tintagel are many and oddly mingled.&nbsp;
The very air seems full of wraiths; the solid and substantial
characters of medi&aelig;val history have their ghosts hovering
about these rugged hills, no less than the more ethereal spectres
of the heroes of Arthurian myth.&nbsp; Tintagel Castle, on the
heights to the west, to which Borrow turned next day, is an
ancient ruin standing on a wonderful site.&nbsp; It has been
familiar to most people for a long time as one of the wildest and
most picturesque scenes in England, and the impression may remain
the same to-day in the minds of those who are imaginative enough
to be able to blot out of the picture the incongruous
achievements of the modern hotel-builder.&nbsp; But it was not so
well known to any but Cornishmen when Borrow visited it, for that
was long before the iron road had reached within thirty miles of
it.&nbsp; The fable of Arthur&rsquo;s birth in the impregnable
fortress, Dundagil, whose remains now stand gaunt and silent on
their rocky eminence, may be dismissed by a date.&nbsp; The
architecture of the original castle was Norman; the rebuilding
took place in the thirteenth century.&nbsp; There is now a great
gulch 200 feet wide between the cliff where the two principal
courts stood and the &ldquo;island&rdquo;; it was formerly much
narrower, and is reputed to have been spanned by a
drawbridge.&nbsp; Yet it is pleasant to <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>dream, as
Borrow did and as Tennyson did when he lived at Boscastle a year
or two later meditating his Idylls, that this was the veritable
scene where the blameless King held court, and the Knights of the
Round Table served him.&nbsp; Tennyson has shackled the Arthurian
legend to Tintagel with links that can never be broken.&nbsp; And
it is also pleasant to recall the more authentic and more
historical connections of the place&mdash;that twelfth century
when the Castle was a great stronghold, when the little chapel of
St. Julitta was founded upon the height to the west of the
island; those days in the thirteenth century when Tintagel was in
such height of glory, when David Prince of Wales, seeking refuge
in his struggle with Henry the Third, received the hospitality of
its Cornish lord.&nbsp; It is not a far cry across the Bristol
Channel, past Lundy, to the coast of Wales, and as he looked
northward over the grey sea, Borrow could hardly have resisted
the customary emotions that the thought of Wales created in him,
with his memories of the procession of the bards from Ab Gwylim
by Elis Wyn to Gronwy Owen.</p>
<p>But this was rich ground for him, and he was fully employed in
absorbing impressions of men and events, past and present, which
he briefly recorded in the two notebooks that were afterwards
meant to be expanded into his work on Cornwall.&nbsp; There was
the quaint harbour of Boscastle near by; there was Forrabury
minster, the &ldquo;silent tower of Bottreux,&rdquo; <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>with its
bell-legend&mdash;the story of the peal of bells which an Earl of
Bottreux presented to Forrabury in order that its music might
rival that of Tintagel, the wreck of the ship which conveyed them
from London just off the shore while Tintagel was sounding the
curfew, the warning rung for mariners on that grim lee shore by
the buried bells when a storm is approaching from the
Atlantic.&nbsp; There was the lovely waterfall of St.
Knighton&rsquo;s Kieve.&nbsp; Borrow had a taste in waterfalls,
and was eloquent in describing them, though unscientific, as Dr.
Russel Wallace has pointed out.&nbsp; The venerable evolutionist,
remarking on the progress of his doctrine, illustrated it by the
fact that so great a writer as George Borrow could speak of a
waterfall as being in all details as it was &ldquo;&lsquo;since
the day of creation, and will probably remain to the day of
judgment.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; There were other
associations&mdash;political in kind&mdash;which would not have
rejoiced him so exceedingly; he had no great love for
politicians, especially of the Whig sort who had controlled most
of the forty odd pocket boroughs of Cornwall.&nbsp; Bossiney was
one of them, the hamlet close to Tintagel, whose chief claim to
utility after it ceased to return two members to Parliament was
that it contained a smithy.</p>
<p>On the wild coast to the west, at that time almost
inaccessible and unknown&mdash;where now the tripper in his
thousands hears the music of the Atlantic on Trebarwith
Strand&mdash;he spent three days, walking <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>long
distances and reaching as far west as Pentire Point, which guards
the Bay of Padstow.&nbsp; On the return journey he took the
inland road, through St. Minver and Egloshayle (&ldquo;the church
by the stream&rdquo;), where, to avoid the evils of continual
tidal bores, a pious fifteenth-century parson got up a
subscription to build the noble bridge of seventeen arches that
spans the River Camel.&nbsp; At Pengelly, close to the celebrated
slate quarries of Delabole, he made the last entry in his Cornish
journal.&nbsp; He is sitting in the little parlour of the old
Delabole Arms, and sees two prints on the wall with inscriptions
in French: &ldquo;Le Revd. Dr. Amour,&rdquo; and &ldquo;A
l&rsquo;Amour il faut se rendre.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In the
latter print,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;quite an angelic <i>petit
ma&icirc;tre</i>.&nbsp; The March of Gentility has reached
Pengelley!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having packed up his things at Penquite and said good-bye to
his Cornish relations, he turned his face eastwards, and was in
London on February 10th.</p>
<p>To lovers of Borrow, even to mere admirers of his genius, it
must always be a cause of regret&mdash;vain enough, but none the
less sorrowful&mdash;that among his numerous failures was the
failure to write the book on Cornwall advertised when &ldquo;The
Romany Rye&rdquo; was published.&nbsp; Perhaps a reason or two
may not be far to seek.&nbsp; It has already been seen that
&ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; on which he had expended the labour of
years, was received with icy indifference by the public and <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>with torrid
hostility by the critics.&nbsp; The fate of his darling book did
much to embitter several years of his life.&nbsp; The visit to
Cornwall broke into this grey period like a burst of sunshine
into a wintry day; it was warm and friendly there, redolent of
beautiful memories of the father he adored; the simple and
hospitable people he met were full of homely kindness, with just
a piquant suspicion of hero-worship; the country itself was full
of charm.&nbsp; The whole experience interested, even inspired
him, and no one can doubt that while he was in Cornwall, and for
some time after he left it, he fully intended that the promised
book should be written.&nbsp; He had talked over the project with
the Taylors at Penquite; later he arranged the matter with John
Murray.</p>
<p>Then came distractions.&nbsp; When he returned from the land
of saints and pixies to London and the east, it was to resume
work upon that Appendix in which he was pouring out the
overflowing vials of his wrath upon his critics, upon the army of
his mortal enemies, upon the mythical myriads of those whom he
supposed to be placing obstacles in the path towards official
employment which he desired to tread.&nbsp; He filled his letters
and bored his friends with the mournful burden of his complaint
against Governments and authorities, lords and notabilities, who
to his distorted imagination seemed to be in league against the
interests and prosperity of George Henry Borrow.&nbsp; Amid these
glooms the ray of sunshine faded.&nbsp; In <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>London he
had none of the liveliness that possessed him in the West; morose
and melancholy moods alternated with savage outbursts against his
foes&mdash;even though he spent a considerable part of his time
in so cheerful a haunt as the library of the British Museum,
looking for material with which to confute and confound
them.&nbsp; At last &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; came out.&nbsp;
It was as great a failure as &ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its
reception disheartened him for literary work, and the Cornish
book receded farther into the distance.&nbsp; Finally, his
adventures in Wales intervened, and he chose rather to write of
them than of the smaller subject of which he might have made a
better book, fine as &ldquo;Wild Wales&rdquo; unquestionably
is.</p>
<p>There was so much good material in his Cornish tour, and in
the lore and gossip which he drank in so avidly, that the
disjointed notes of his impressions do only create a thirst for
more.&nbsp; In his printed works there are but few references to
the Duchy in the West.&nbsp; There is the passage in
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; where he speaks of his father&rsquo;s
Cornish descent, and quotes the proverb, &ldquo;In Cornwall are
the best gentlemen.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in &ldquo;Wild Wales&rdquo;
there is another adage which he had picked up in the
West&mdash;the &ldquo;proverb in the Gerniweg . . . which was the
language of my forefathers, saying, &lsquo;Ne&rsquo;er leave the
old way for the new&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;the theme, by the way, of
a Cornish ballad given in Llhuyd&rsquo;s <i>Arch&aelig;ologia
Britannica</i> and translated by Borrow.&nbsp; That is all.&nbsp;
The book he would <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>have written on this land of miracles and fairies, of
Celtic legend, of the last struggles of the British race in
England against their Germanic conquerors, the land where the
language of the ancient people was spoken within the memory of
gossips with whom he conversed, where the very names of people
and places were fragrant of the old order, where</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By Tre, Pol, and Pen,<br />
You may know the Cornishmen,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>such a book would have been worth having.&nbsp; A Celt in mind
and blood and bone, he would have written it with sympathy, and
he would have found it a subject not nearly so keenly exploited
as the Wales of which he afterwards wrote, or the Manxland where
he compiled similar journals in a later year.</p>
<p>Within the comparatively brief time he allowed himself, Borrow
saw a great deal that was characteristic of Cornwall.&nbsp; It is
a county of many characters, with industries and employments
various if small.&nbsp; Its patriotic toast is: &ldquo;Fish,
Copper, and Tin.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this triple sentiment
agriculture might be appropriately added.&nbsp; Borrow saw them
all.&nbsp; He saw farming in the hills in his own family and
among their friends.&nbsp; He watched tin and copper mining in
the Caradons, and saw how the West-countrymen</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . . . From the bleak Cornubian shore<br
/>
Dispense the mineral treasure which of old<br />
Sidonian pilots sought,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>as
the imaginative Akenside has it.&nbsp; Mount&rsquo;s Bay was
encircled by legends of the Ph&oelig;nicians and their voyages to
the &ldquo;Cassiterides&rdquo; for tin.&nbsp; At
Newlyn&mdash;long before it became the most bepainted village in
three kingdoms&mdash;and at Mousehole with his friend Burney, he
saw the fishing industry in full operation.&nbsp; We should have
had from him many a burst of the dialogue of which he was a
consummate master&mdash;as with Henry Goodman, the nonagenarian
of Tremar, and with the old men he met in Dolly Pentreath&rsquo;s
parish of Paul&mdash;and the Cornish language, once spoken
throughout the South of England, would have been discussed, if
not in sufficiently learned style to satisfy the expert, at any
rate in a way that would have made for the entertainment of
mankind at large.</p>
<p>We have read of his Cornish father&rsquo;s prowess in
&ldquo;the art of fisticuffery,&rdquo; and might certainly have
looked for a spirited account of the affair at Bodmin Bridge when
the terror of all Plymouth and Devonport was vanquished, and
another of the fracas at Menheniot Fair.&nbsp; But we should
probably also have had an essay upon an art which has always been
far more popular in Cornwall than boxing&mdash;that is, the art
of wrestling.&nbsp; We may be sure he would have expressed his
patriotic preference for the Cornish over the Devonshire
style.&nbsp; He might have agreed with Touchstone that
&ldquo;breaking ribs&rdquo; was not sport for ladies, but he
would have regretted its decline because <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>it was a
vigorous and manly game, and he would have fastened upon the
career of the great wrestler Polkinghorne, whose contest with the
Devonshire hero Cann, on Tamar Green at Devonport in 1826, was a
Homeric battle worthy the pen of him who discoursed of that great
fight in which Thurtell was &ldquo;lord of the
concourse.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would have given us the true
inwardness of &ldquo;the Cornish hug&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Flying
Mare,&rdquo; and might even have cited the ballad of Will Treffry
and Little Jan, whose untimely end left sorrowing the lady who
was to have been his bride that very day:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Then, with a desperate
toss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will showed the Flying Hoss,<br />
And Little Jan fell on the tan,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And never more he spake.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, Little Jan,
alack!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ladies say, Oh, woe&rsquo;s the day!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, Little Jan,
alack!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But most of all do I miss such a treatise as should have grown
out of his exploration of the Tintagel country, speculating in
what degree he would have adopted the Cornish theory of Arthur,
what he would have made of the mass of tradition and romance that
has collected about that stretch of coast.&nbsp; One may imagine
how his mind would have followed the legend of Arthur from its
birthplace in the Far North down through his beloved Wales to the
spot on which he stood before the crumbling walls of Dundagil,
out of whose silent ruins Tennyson&rsquo;s imagination was about
<a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>to
construct his marvellous picture of the stately halls of
Camelot.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s would have been a vastly different
story from Tennyson&rsquo;s idealisation of the mystery of
Arthur&rsquo;s life, and still more startling would have been its
contrast with the version of the master-mystic of these parts,
the immortal Vicar of Morwenstow. <a name="citation205"></a><a
href="#footnote205" class="citation">[205]</a>&nbsp; This in
spite of the fact that, as Hawker said, he worked into his poem
&ldquo;The Record and Rationale of Keltic Cornwall, the rock,
barrow, moor, mountain all there, with the spirit of our fathers
rehearsing their intent&rdquo;&mdash;for Hawker&rsquo;s Catholic
theology would have been anathema to the Papist-hater, Borrow,
and the man who wrote supporting the Bull of Pius IX.,
promulgated that very year, would inevitably have been placed on
the Borrovian index.&nbsp; Borrow would rather have harked back
to Walter Mapes, and beyond him to Malory, and beyond him to
Geoffrey of Monmouth.&nbsp; His Arthur&rsquo;s mother would have
been the wife of Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall, and Uther would have
been his father.&nbsp; His Arthur would have wed the daughter of
Leodegraunce, King of Camelyard; the Table Round&mdash;the most
valuable accretion which Cornwall has given to the
legend&mdash;would have been Arthur&rsquo;s wedding present from
Leodegraunce, who would have received it from Uter Pendragon, for
whom it would have been made by Merlin, Prince of
Enchanters.&nbsp; Camelot would have been Camelford, and not
Winchester, <a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>nor Queen Camel in Somerset; and we might have had a
discussion of the question what Shakespeare meant when he made
Kent in <i>King Lear</i> say to the Duke of Cornwall:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Goose, if I had you upon Sarum Plain,<br />
I&rsquo;d drive ye cackling home to Camelot.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The argument in favour of Queen Camel is that on the moors in
that neighbourhood it is customary to breed geese; but then,
geese are among the common objects of the Cornish moors.</p>
<p>We should not have lacked, either, some examination of the
scanty literature of Old Cornwall, of the <i>Pascon Agan
Arluth</i>, the Passion of Our Lord, of the trilogy of poems on
The Beginning of the World, the Passion, and the
Resurrection.&nbsp; We should have heard of the Miracle Plays,
which continued to be performed in the amphitheatres or
&ldquo;rounds&rdquo; of Cornwall well into the seventeenth
century&mdash;the ancient drama of <i>Meriasek</i>, Duke of
Brittany, and the corrupt sixteenth-century masque of &ldquo;The
Creation of the World, with Noah&rsquo;s Flood&rdquo;; and we
should have been told with approval of these plays that, like
those of Brittany, they were far more reverent and more decent
than the corresponding performances in the English and French
languages.</p>
<p>Such a book, in Borrow&rsquo;s inimitable prose, with the
interludes and dialogues whose supreme merit Ford was quick to
perceive, would have been invaluable.&nbsp; The subject is so
luxuriant in interest and so <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>novel that it might well have had a
far greater success than anything he had written since &ldquo;The
Bible in Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; But its only place is on the long
list of the Unwritten Books of the world, a literary ellipsis
deplored but never to be filled.</p>
<h2><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE LAND OF ELIS WYN</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> these years of the fulness of
his manhood, the wandering spirit possessed and compelled
Borrow.&nbsp; It dragged him all over the United Kingdom in
search of such adventure and distraction as he could find.&nbsp;
He allowed his work on &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; to be held up
by the scheme of a tour in Wales.&nbsp; With his wife and Miss
Clarke he spent the summer and autumn of 1854 in the land of the
Cymry.&nbsp; This expedition was on different lines from any he
had ever undertaken before.&nbsp; He was far more tractable than
of old, far more &ldquo;civilised&rdquo; than when, in his youth,
he had roamed the highways and lived in the hedges and the
inns.&nbsp; He was far more comfortable, but also sadly less
dramatic than while rummaging the peninsula for gypsy lore.&nbsp;
He went about these travels with a much less romantic spirit than
he had manifested in his Cornish journeys.</p>
<p>Wales&mdash;its literature, its history, its language, and its
bards&mdash;had been a passion of his life.&nbsp; When he set
about making its personal acquaintance, the heat of the amour had
cooled off, and he became a tourist rather than a picaro.&nbsp;
Some years later he published <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>a full record of his travels and
experiences.&nbsp; At that time the world was far less interested
in George Borrow than it had been, and few people took the
trouble to compare &ldquo;Wild Wales&rdquo; with his other
books.&nbsp; But a later generation, which has found a new
interest in him, has made many comparisons.&nbsp; One of the
commonest observations is that the new book differs from its
predecessors in that it is a mild and pleasant record of travel;
idiosyncrasies and angularities are there, it is true, but the
book is not all fads and angles.&nbsp; Many reasons have been
given for this.&nbsp; One of the most ingenious is that Borrow
was accompanied by two ladies who knew exactly what he was doing,
and that he dared neither seek the vulgar adventures that give
colour to his other works, nor invent them in order to add purple
patches where they seemed necessary for artistic effect.&nbsp;
One declines to adopt this theory.&nbsp; Borrow may have been
somewhat restrained by the presence of his wife and her daughter
while he lived with them at Llangollen.&nbsp; But he was often
away for considerable periods on walking excursions, and, in the
latter part of his tour, when he tramped through Wales from north
to south, he was entirely alone.&nbsp; There could have been no
restraint upon him then.&nbsp; He was at liberty to seek out the
most disreputable company he pleased, to consort with gypsies, or
tinkers, or the scum of the earth&mdash;if it can be admitted
without treason that Wales contains any scum.&nbsp; That Borrow
was induced <a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>by the influence of his womenkind to moderate the tone
of his writing is a thing one cannot believe: he returned at the
end of the year to their company at Yarmouth, to add some of the
most vitriolic passages to &ldquo;The Romany Rye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two sets of circumstances may more fitly account for the
character of &ldquo;Wild Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; One is that Borrow
had idealised Wales in his mind, and that he went about it
determined to see only what was good and noble in the country and
its people.&nbsp; His early enthusiasm for its language had given
birth to an extraordinary passion for its literature, and a
hero-worshipping devotion to its great ones.&nbsp; To him there
were no mountains like the Welsh mountains of which he had
dreamed in his boyhood among the fenlands of Norfolk.&nbsp; To
him there were no princes to be compared with the Welsh
chieftains who resisted the tide of Saxon aggression.&nbsp; He
might pretend as stoutly as he pleased that the Anglo-Saxon race
was the flower of the earth, that there were no finer fellows in
the records of chivalry than the English prize-fighters, and that
there was no nectar to be mentioned with English ale.&nbsp; But
when, as in Cornwall and Wales, he was among the Celts from whom
he sprang, all this superficial structure of association tumbled
down, and his true and native soul breathed its proper
atmosphere.&nbsp; Wales was all good to him.&nbsp; His delight
and admiration were unfeigned.&nbsp; They appear in the book, and
they appear equally in the <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>notes unused in the book, which Dr.
Knapp has preserved.</p>
<p>The second set of circumstances relates to the date at which
the book was published.&nbsp; It did not appear till 1862.&nbsp;
By that time (he would have been the last man to admit it) some
home-truths had been forced upon Borrow.&nbsp; He had discovered
that the game he played with the public in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; was not worth the candle.&nbsp;
He wanted to write a popular book, and to regain some of the
ground he had lost.&nbsp; The public did not like his anti-Popery
screeds; he deliberately excised anything that could offend them
in that respect, as will be seen.&nbsp; The public did not care
twopence about his gypsies and would rather be without
them.&nbsp; He deliberately avoided any reference to the gypsies
of Wales, though they were perhaps the most interesting and the
most intelligent of the Romany tribes inhabiting the British
Isles.</p>
<p>During his Welsh wanderings Borrow was more than ever the
philologist let loose.&nbsp; His joy was unbounded in the
discovery of persons who said to him &ldquo;Dim Saesneg,&rdquo;
signifying that they did not understand English, in the exercise
of his Welsh upon them, in their astonishment that there should
be one tall Englishman striding through Wales who could speak to
them in their own vernacular.&nbsp; His Welsh has been criticised
with a certain degree of justice.&nbsp; It was book-learnt.&nbsp;
But it was a sufficiently good <a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>working medium to enable him to get
into closer touch with the people than he could have done with
English alone.&nbsp; When he was reciting Welsh verses on the top
of Snowdon, a native asked him whether he came from
Brittany.&nbsp; The variation which the Celtic language underwent
in its journey through Cornwall into Armorica is surprisingly
slight.&nbsp; The present writer was sailing once in a boat off
the coast of Finist&egrave;re with two Breton fishermen,
exploring certain grottoes inhabited by the korrigans, which take
the place of pixies in Brittany, and found some difficulty in
reconciling their French with any standard known to him.&nbsp;
But, they said, if against his next visit he would learn to speak
&ldquo;Ouelsh,&rdquo; some interesting and profitable discourse
would be easy.&nbsp; And they might have been, for all their
appearance, two dark-eyed denizens of Mevagissey or the Cardigan
coast.</p>
<p>If Borrow had only a literary acquaintance with the language,
he had a spiritual affinity with the land and the people.&nbsp;
Welshmen admit that &ldquo;Wild Wales&rdquo; is one of the finest
books on their country ever produced, either by Welsh or English
writers.&nbsp; Indeed, it could hardly fall short of that, being
the work of a man fascinated by his subject, who maintained a
high pitch of enthusiasm for every phase of it, whether he was
escorting his ladies to see fine prospects in the neighbourhood
of Llangollen or making excursions with John Jones, the Methodist
<a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>weaver,
or visiting simple cottages to drink milk and talk with their
inhabitants of the works of the Bards and Mystics over which he
had pored long years ago in the corporation library at Norwich,
or entertaining rough miners with ghost stories in mountain
hostelries.</p>
<p>While the best episodes of the tour are given in the book, the
incidents recorded in his diary and omitted from the published
work possess one or two features of interest.&nbsp; For instance,
as Dr. Knapp points out, the interview with the Irishman on the
road between Cerrig y Drudion and Cernioge Mawr would have been
much improved in point of realism if Borrow had included in it
the words of the song, &ldquo;Croppies, lie down!&rdquo; and the
objurgations of the patriotic fiddler on each verse of this
p&aelig;an of the detested Orangemen.&nbsp; The scene appeared in
this form in his original draft.&nbsp; But there were reasons,
already set out, why he did not want just at this time to declaim
to the public:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whoop! Protestants, whoop!<br />
And drink full of hope,<br />
Bad luck to the Devil, Pretender, and Pope!<br />
And down, down, Croppies, lie down!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That truculent song, which had been &ldquo;the delight of the
young gentlemen of the Protestant Academy of that beautiful old
town&rdquo; of Clonmel, would not have been the delight of the
British people at large when &ldquo;Wild Wales&rdquo; was issued
from the press, and <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>Borrow had learnt enough to know
that.&nbsp; The other principal omission from the book is the
Ghost Story of Lope de Vega.&nbsp; We may accept without regret
the fact that he did not print the account of the duel on
Wimbledon Common between Colonel Lennox and the Duke of York,
which has nothing to do with anything in particular.&nbsp; But
the Ghost Story was originally set in a most suitable framework,
and would have read well.&nbsp; He always maintained that it was
<i>facile princeps</i> among ghost stories, and, with due homage
to the Society for Psychical Research, one may admit that his
judgment was not far wrong.&nbsp; He got the tale from an English
translation of the Romance, <i>El Peregrino en su Patria</i>,
published in London in 1738.&nbsp; He told it to a company of
miners assembled in the inn of Guter Vawr, with whom he had some
difficulty at first in getting upon terms of amity.&nbsp; Borrow
may have lacked colloquial knowledge of the Welsh language, but
he had something which was better: he appreciated with the
keenest relish its musical charm, and he admired it without
stint.&nbsp; He understood the people and their ways of thought,
and could accommodate himself to their habits.&nbsp; He idolised
their heroes and poets.&nbsp; Thus he got outside himself more in
&ldquo;Wild Wales&rdquo; than he succeeded in doing in any other
book, and the observation has been very justly made upon it that
it is an itinerary rather than an autobiography.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, it throws an interesting light on some facets <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>of his
character, and is a book which his friends must love because it
displays him in happier moods and under warmer skies than most of
his writings.</p>
<p>The clouds lowered again after the exaltation of the Welsh
tour.&nbsp; He returned from the mountains and the bards, from
the rarefied atmosphere of Snowdonia and the warmth of his
welcome by a Celtic society, to sordid disputes and wordy
warfares about his new book, &ldquo;The Romany Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was exactly four years before that Murray had begun imploring
him to &ldquo;give the new volumes the finishing
touches.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had been &ldquo;touching&rdquo; them
with a vengeance, and the finish was not at all to Murray&rsquo;s
taste.&nbsp; He completed the task soon after his arrival in
Yarmouth, and packed off the manuscript to Albemarle
Street.&nbsp; That respectable thoroughfare was next door to
being scandalised by the contents of the parcel.&nbsp; True,
Murray put his criticisms in a friendly way, but they were strong
criticisms, and they were backed by literary opinions of some
weight.&nbsp; But Borrow had experienced a surfeit of critics,
and his anger was supreme.&nbsp; He told Murray he had given him
the manuscript on condition that it should not pass out of his
hands, and complained that it had been shown round among several
people.&nbsp; He declared that he was not anxious to publish it,
a statement from which the usual discount must be
subtracted.&nbsp; He proceeded to describe it as &ldquo;one of
the most learned works ever written&rdquo; (this with Mrs. Borrow
as his mouthpiece, <a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>for decency&rsquo;s sake), and his manifesto then
diffused itself in renewed attacks on the foes of
&ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; refusal to have anything to do with
Murray&rsquo;s suggestion for a book on Russia, and a
denunciation of England as an ingrate country.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
owed much to him, and he owed nothing to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s books not only took a long time to write, but
had a bad habit of hanging about after they had been
written.&nbsp; Many things happened before &ldquo;The Romany
Rye&rdquo; appeared to a bewildered public, holding the critics
&ldquo;up by their tails.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the meantime, the
Romany Rye himself had been wandering again.&nbsp; He was, as De
Quincey said of Descartes, &ldquo;as restless as a
hyena.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1855 he took his wife and Miss Clarke to
another out-of-the-way corner of Celtic Britain&mdash;the Isle of
Man.&nbsp; Making Douglas his headquarters, he explored the
country thoroughly, generally alone and on foot.&nbsp; He was on
the look-out for the material for another book, which, as in the
case of the Cornish volume, remained a project.&nbsp; He did get
as far as the title, &ldquo;Bayr Jairgey and Glion Doo: The Red
Path and the Black Valley,&rdquo; and prepared an introduction
for it.</p>
<p>The Isle of Man was at that time, in the literary sense, an
unoccupied country, and Borrow would have worked over a fertile
field of virgin soil if he had carried out his purpose.&nbsp;
There was no Manx Society; there was no Manx
<i>Miscellany</i>.&nbsp; The Runes were <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>there for
him to decipher and describe; the poetry and the history of the
island were at his disposal to exploit.&nbsp; &ldquo;In lone
farmhouses and cottages situated in gills and glens&rdquo; were
the &ldquo;smoke-stained volumes&rdquo; of &ldquo;carvals&rdquo;
in manuscript, poems of the people, which he diligently searched
out while penetrating the recesses of the island.&nbsp; The
carvals&mdash;<i>Anglice</i>, carols&mdash;are mostly on Biblical
subjects and of no great antiquity.&nbsp; Borrow got possession
of two volumes and examined the contents of many.&nbsp; He had
only a slight acquaintance with the Manx language, but his
general knowledge of Gaelic stood him in good stead as he puzzled
his way through the carval of &ldquo;Joseph,&rdquo; or of
&ldquo;David and Goliath,&rdquo; or of &ldquo;The Evil
Women,&rdquo; of which last he remarks that it is written in
dispraise of the sex and recalls the poem of Simonides on the
same subject.&nbsp; It is the work of an eighteenth-century
smuggler named Moore, whose misogyny was displayed in an original
fashion&mdash;by picking out all the bad characters of the
feminine persuasion in the Holy Scriptures and relating their
most wicked deeds.&nbsp; Borrow says it &ldquo;is a curious
piece, and must certainly have found its way abroad without
clerical sanction.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was not more interested in
these effusions than in the scanty printed literature of the
island&mdash;such as the ballads of &ldquo;Brown William&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Myle Charaine.&rdquo;&nbsp; The former (&ldquo;Ilian
Dhu&rdquo; in the vernacular) commemorates one John William
Christian, a Receiver of the Isle of <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>Man, who at the time of the
Restoration was executed on Hangoe Hill because he had
surrendered to Cromwell. <a name="citation218"></a><a
href="#footnote218" class="citation">[218]</a>&nbsp; Borrow
translated this poem, and also the ballad of &ldquo;Myle
Charaine,&rdquo; the miser, which he entitles &ldquo;Mollie
Charane.&rdquo;&nbsp; His version was published in <i>Once a
Week</i>.&nbsp; He was fond enough of it to go hunting for the
miser&rsquo;s descendants on a lonely curragh, much to the
amazement of the good people, who could not understand that the
possession of an ancestor who happened to have been mentioned in
a poem was any good reason for the invasion of their
privacy.&nbsp; His keenest taste, however, took him much farther
back into the mists of the past than the balladists of the
eighteenth century.&nbsp; Was not the early history of the island
a record of the lives and deeds of his beloved Danes and
Norsemen?&nbsp; Were not their sepulchral monuments to be seen in
the Runic stones?&nbsp; And, more distant still, were there not
the legends and the fragments of half-lost songs of Finn, the
Celtic hero whose exploits are celebrated in so many lands?&nbsp;
He had encountered Finn in Ireland.&nbsp; He had found him in
Cornwall under the wing of the Irish guide, Cronan.&nbsp; Here he
met him <a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>again.&nbsp; Walking with Borrow on Snaefell, a miner
of Laxey, James Skillicorn (who was the donor of one of his two
volumes of carvals) recited a Manx tradition of
Finn&mdash;&ldquo;a mighty man of valour and a swift
runner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were two giants (so the tale ran) rejoicing in the name
of Finn; of these, Finn McCoul, a huge giant, was Scottish, and
Finn McCoyle, a lesser giant, was Manx.&nbsp; The Scots Finn,
hearing rumours of the fame of the Manx Finn, and feeling some
jealousy, decided to visit him in order that they might try their
strength.&nbsp; So he waded across from the southernmost point of
Scotland to the northernmost point of the island.&nbsp;
Finn&rsquo;s wife answered the door to him, and was at once
stricken with amazement and fear at his gigantic
proportions.&nbsp; She saw that her husband, who was inside lying
on the bed, would be no match for him, and therefore told him
that McCoyle was not at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the great fellow lying on the bed?&rdquo; asked
McCoul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a little son of ours,&rdquo; said the astute Mrs.
McCoyle.</p>
<p>The visiting giant then asked for something to eat, and she
said she would give him a cake such as they were in the habit of
eating, and presented him with an iron platter.</p>
<p>McCoul crunched it to powder between his teeth, and swallowed
it with the utmost relish.</p>
<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>Then
McCoyle, assuming the part his wife had invented for him, and
pretending to be the son of a mighty father, offered to take
McCoul out to his father&rsquo;s playing-ground and show him the
ball with which he played.&nbsp; Having reached the place,
McCoyle directed the visitor&rsquo;s attention to a round crag of
rock, weighing something more than a ton, which he said was his
father&rsquo;s skittle-ball.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you do anything
with that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>McCoul seized it, threw it a mile high, and caught it
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; cried the crafty McCoyle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see you do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as he threw the rock up into the sky again, McCoyle went
behind him and gave him a push which sent him over the cliff,
where he was dashed in a thousand pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such an end,&rdquo; says the tale, &ldquo;may all those
have who come over the water expressly, as the Scottish giant
did, to bully the decent people of Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Cornwall Borrow found the ancient language dead; in the
Isle of Man he found it rapidly dying out of common use, and not
much cultivated for literary purposes.&nbsp; The Church services
in Manx were being discontinued.&nbsp; Deploring all this
greatly, he still went on studying it.&nbsp; He was no lover of
Methodists&mdash;placing them in one of his comprehensive
categories with &ldquo;Whigs, Muggletonians, and Latter-day
Saints.&rdquo;&nbsp; But his political and religious <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>prejudices
did not interfere with his love of the Celtic tongues or his
devotion to poetry in any form, and when he had nothing else to
do he sat in his lodgings and read Killey&rsquo;s translation
into Manx of the Methodist Hymn Book.&nbsp; Killey&rsquo;s other
chief work was the translation of Parnell&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Hermit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why anybody should want to translate
that highly overrated piece of Queen Annery into any language at
all, it is hard to say.&nbsp; His choice of subjects, however,
did not deter Borrow from paying homage to him and going to see
his daughter, with whom he had a discussion on the effects of
Methodism in the island.&nbsp; It was summed up in the best
Borrovian oracular manner: &ldquo;The Methodists have done much
good in Man,&rdquo; he said to her, &ldquo;but their doctrines
and teaching have contributed much to destroy the poetical
traditions of the people.&rdquo;&nbsp; This dictum was very like
that which R. S. Hawker proclaimed of the Methodists in
Cornwall.&nbsp; But Hawker did not allow that they had done any
good at all.&nbsp; Wesley, he said, caused the Cornish people to
&ldquo;<i>change</i> their Sins and called it conversion. . .
.&nbsp; With my last Breath I protest that the Man Wesley
corrupted and depraved instead of improving the West of England.
. . .&nbsp; The Vices of the Body are not after all, bad as they
are, so hateful as the Sins of the Mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow was
nearer the truth than Hawker.&nbsp; But it may be doubted whether
the spread of Methodism had much, if anything, to do with the <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>evanishment
of old poetic traditions; the march of industrialism and the
increasing fluidity of population were the real culprits.</p>
<p>Borrow trod the red path and explored the black
glen&mdash;whose magnificence he did not praise too
highly&mdash;and inspected carvals, climbed walls to look at
carved stones, sketched with Henrietta, and generally enjoyed
himself for several weeks.&nbsp; It was the autumn of the fall of
Sebastopol.&nbsp; The news reached the island on September 10th,
and provoked some of Borrow&rsquo;s most fiery denunciations of
politicians and soldiers&mdash;the offence being that the French
had taken the Malakoff and the British had been repulsed from the
Redan.&nbsp; &ldquo;The war might have been gloriously settled
nearly a year ago by the English, and they have got all the
credit of the affair, but for the inactivity and indecision of
that miserable creature Raglan, the aristocratical leader of the
English and the secret friend of the Russians. . . .&nbsp; Much
shouting in Douglas and firing of guns in the harbour, though for
what reason it would be difficult to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s patriotism was of a peculiar kind.&nbsp; He had
the type of mind which was generally &ldquo;agin the
Government,&rdquo; and few of the operations of British
statesmanship, either at home or abroad, gave him any
satisfaction.&nbsp; Yet there never was a man who took more pride
in the fact that he was an Englishman.&nbsp; The sight of The
Rock moved him to paroxysms of patriotism.&nbsp; When he begins a
paragraph, <a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>&ldquo;O, England!&rdquo; the experienced reader knows
what to expect, and all Radicals and other subversive persons may
&ldquo;stand clear,&rdquo; as they say at sea.&nbsp; But even
they will forgive him because the quality of his martial music is
so high.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O England! long, long may it be before ere
the sun of thy glory sink beneath the wave of darkness!&nbsp;
Though gloomy and portentous clouds are now gathering rapidly
round thee, still, still may it please the Almighty to disperse
them, and to grant thee a futurity longer in duration and still
brighter in renown than thy past!&nbsp; Or, if thy doom be at
hand, may that doom be a noble one and worthy of her who has been
styled the Old Queen of the Waters.&nbsp; May thou sink, if thou
dost sink, amid blood and flame, with a mighty noise, causing
more than one nation to participate in thy downfall!&nbsp; Of all
fates, may it please the Lord to preserve thee from a disgraceful
and a slow decay; becoming, ere extinct, a scorn and a mockery
for those selfsame foes who now, though they envy and abhor thee,
still fear thee, nay, even against their will, honour and respect
thee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor will the reader be shocked or surprised to learn that
these somewhat unpacific and heathen sentiments formed
&ldquo;part of a broken prayer for my native land, which, after
my usual thanksgiving, I breathed to the Almighty ere retiring to
rest that Sunday night at Gibraltar.&rdquo;&nbsp; Like many other
Englishmen, he seemed to find more to admire in the institutions
and the character of his country when he was at a distance than
when he was at home.</p>

224</span>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">LONDON AGAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the return to Yarmouth, the
trials of a crotchety temper were resumed.&nbsp; Murray&rsquo;s
reception of &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; so inflamed
Borrow&rsquo;s anger that in April, 1856, he recalled the
precious manuscript in the curtest of curt notes.&nbsp; Murray,
nothing loth to rid himself of this wild book, with its tigerish
animadversions upon the literary world at large, packed it up and
sent it to Yarmouth, where it remained for another year.&nbsp;
Its author, in high dudgeon, kept his mind as far as possible off
his grievances by tramping about East Anglia and endeavouring to
reawaken the sensations of his youth upon the English
roads.&nbsp; He rejoices in the sight of a coach, which even then
seemed a strange anachronism, so thoroughly had the railway
revolutionised the conditions of travel.&nbsp; He is carried back
thirty years to the days of Thurtell by a meeting with an old man
who remembered the mill between Painter and Oliver, and could
call up visions of the concourse of pilfering rascals assembled
on that occasion, so that the adjoining field was found next day
to be strewn with empty pocket-books!&nbsp; He sees a horse fall
down and refuse to rise in a street of <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>King&rsquo;s Lynn, and at once becomes the
horse-doctor, advising the administration of reviving ale
according to one story, and according to another administering it
himself.</p>
<p>Among the visits he paid during these excursions was one to
Miss Anna Gurney at North Repps; he took a speedy departure when
she began to propound to him questions in Arabic grammar, and
consoled himself with a dinner at
&ldquo;Tucker&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this was the kind of life
and experience which, sending his memory back to his early
exploits by grassy lane and windy heath, was bound to turn his
thoughts again to the manuscript stowed away at Yarmouth in which
so many of those adventures were depicted.&nbsp; In the following
February he withdrew it from its hiding-place, read it over
afresh with great relish, and decided that it must be
published.&nbsp; Such good stuff should be withheld from the
public no longer, Murray or no Murray.</p>
<p>Thus an ultimatum was despatched to Albemarle Street.&nbsp;
The eminent publisher was informed that, if he did not bring out
&ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; some less eminent publisher would
be applied to.&nbsp; The firm, always excellent friends to
Borrow, resolved to humour him, but in the letter in which the
bargain was clinched Mr. Murray could not resist a sly dig; he
said the work would be published &ldquo;to oblige
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereat Borrow told him that he believed his
intentions were good, but that &ldquo;people with <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>the best of
intentions occasionally do a great deal of harm.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; appeared in May.</p>
<p>If the reception of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; disappointed its
author, no less can be said of the reception of its sequel.&nbsp;
The majority of the critics did not like it any better than
Borrow liked them.&nbsp; Even his friend Whitwell Elwin, who
reviewed it for the <i>Quarterly</i>, reproved him vigorously for
the violence and vulgarity of the Appendix, and threw Bentley at
him in this wise: &ldquo;No author was ever written down except
by himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Elwin was fair, and more prescient
than most of his contemporaries.&nbsp; He admitted that
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; had not had its due, and said that it
contained &ldquo;passages which, in their way, are not surpassed
by anything in English literature.&rdquo;&nbsp; He spoke with
warmth of the truth and vividness of the descriptions of both
scenes and persons, the purity, force, and simplicity of the
language, which &ldquo;should confer immortality upon many of its
pages.&rdquo;&nbsp; Elwin did not write without knowledge when he
said that &ldquo;various parts of the history are known to be a
faithful narrative of Mr. Borrow&rsquo;s career, while we
ourselves can testify as to many other parts of his volumes, that
nothing can excel the fidelity with which he has described both
men and things.&nbsp; Far from his showing any tendency to
exaggeration, such of his characters as we chance to have
known&mdash;and they are not a few&mdash;are rather within the
truth than <a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>beyond it. . . .&nbsp; There can be no doubt that the
larger part, and possibly the whole, of the work is a narrative
of actual occurrences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The review which most correctly anticipated the verdict of a
later generation, a generation that knew not Borrow but was
emancipated from some of the prejudices of the &rsquo;fifties,
was that of the <i>Saturday Review</i>.&nbsp; The writer saw the
charm of these books&mdash;their raciness, their naturalistic
humour, their spirit of romance.&nbsp; He penetrated the secret
of Borrow&rsquo;s style when he spoke of his &ldquo;almost
affectedly simple language.&rdquo;&nbsp; He realised the
permanent power of a writer who could make such wonderfully
strong impressions without actual categorical description of
scenery or persons.&nbsp; Otherwise, the treatment of the book
was cool and neglectful, or hostile&mdash;in either case highly
unsatisfactory to Borrow.&nbsp; Perhaps we, who can read
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; together,
and view them in a different atmosphere, are hardly able to make
sufficient allowance for the conduct of critics who had this
sequel to a half-forgotten book pitched on their tables after an
interval of six years, and found that its most vigorous passages
consisted of terrific denunciations of their harmless selves.</p>
<p>The disappointed author went off alone in August to seek
solace in a second tour through the country which still held the
warmest place in his affections.&nbsp; He walked through the
greater part of South Wales <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>to the very tip of the Pembrokeshire
promontory, and then cut across to Hereford and Shropshire.&nbsp;
At Uppington and Donnington he sought out the tracks of Gronwy
Owen, and returned to London and Yarmouth once more full of his
Celtic bards and prophets.&nbsp; Occasionally antiquarian
researches were interrupted to give time for original
vaticinations on public affairs.&nbsp; He was a fierce
opinionist, who contrived as a rule to find his opinions on the
side which was against the constituted authority, whatever it
might be.&nbsp; The conduct of Indian policy during the Mutiny
pleased him no better than the conduct of the Russian war.&nbsp;
In a letter to Murray, after defending the tone of &ldquo;The
Romany Rye&rdquo; on the ground that it denounced boldly the
evils which were hurrying the country to destruction and had
kindled God&rsquo;s anger against it, &ldquo;namely, the pride,
insolence, cruelty, covetousness, and hypocrisy of its people,
and, above all, that rage for gentility which must be indulged in
at the expense of every good and honourable feeling,&rdquo; he
goes on to discuss affairs in the East.&nbsp; Some of his
choicest anathemas are reserved for &ldquo;the miserable
newspapers,&rdquo; which proclaimed a firm determination to put
down the rebels in India, &ldquo;but forget to tell us how India
is to be held without the sepoys.&rdquo;&nbsp; The international
situation seemed to his hypochondriac mind to be full of
irremediable gloom, and he turned again, sighing, from these
melancholy reflections to his Welsh poets.&nbsp; His passionate
desire <a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>was reawakened to reveal the wonders of Cymric
literature to a stiff-necked generation of Englishmen.&nbsp; He
had turned out once more his translation of the
&ldquo;Visions&rdquo; of Elis Wyn, which had been too strong for
the stomach of the little bookseller of Smithfield nearly thirty
years before.&nbsp; He delivered it to Murray on his way back
from Wales.&nbsp; Borrow suggested that it would be likely to
sell if it could be adorned with three engravings by
Cruikshank&mdash;&ldquo;the dance of the fairies in the first
part; another the old poet in Hades flinging a skull at the head
of Elis Wyn in the second; and the last, the personification of
Sin in the third part at the very conclusion.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
Murray was no more impressed with the saleable quality of the
Sleeping Bard than the bookseller of Smithfield had been;
Cruikshank continued to throw stones at the Bottle Imp instead of
flinging skulls at Elis Wyn, and the manuscript went back to
Yarmouth.</p>
<p>All literary enterprises were suddenly set aside in August,
1858, by a family tragedy.&nbsp; No less a phrase can describe
Borrow&rsquo;s loss when his mother died, for the bonds between
them were exceedingly close.&nbsp; Her love had a poignant
quality which was sharpened by the anxiety, well-concealed from
him, with which his weaknesses filled her.&nbsp; His love for her
was more than filial.&nbsp; It had kept him in East Anglia for
many years; it had an important influence, which has been
previously suggested, upon his attitude towards the Catholic
Church; he could never forget that it was the <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>revocation
of the Edict of Nantes that drove his mother&rsquo;s family out
of France.</p>
<p>The death occurred rather suddenly.&nbsp; The severance had so
extreme an effect upon him that he was inconsolable during many
weeks.&nbsp; At last, to obtain distraction, he set off on a
walking tour in the Highlands.&nbsp; He devoted much of his time
to roaming all over the island of Mull, which he described as
perhaps the wildest country in Europe.&nbsp; He noted that the
place-names of Mull strongly resembled those of the Isle of Man,
and wrote scraps of discourse on the Gaelic dialects.&nbsp;
Leaving Mull, he penetrated, principally on foot, into the
farthest north, crossing to Orkney and Shetland at the end of
November.&nbsp; A quiet seven months at Yarmouth followed, and in
June, 1859, he paid a visit to Ireland.&nbsp; Mrs. Borrow and
Miss Clarke remained in Dublin while he plodded through the
country.&nbsp; He walked to the wilds of Connemara, pursuing his
customary line of inquiry into language and legend, and thence
extended his tramp to the Giants&rsquo; Causeway.&nbsp; In Dublin
he studied with zest the records of the associations which were
exploring the ancient literature of the country, and gloated over
the stories of Finn and Ossian.&nbsp; He became a member of the
Ossianic Society soon after his arrival in the Irish
capital.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Borrow left no record of the tour
or of his studies in Dublin.</p>
<p>Ireland was, indeed, soon forgotten after his return <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>home in
November.&nbsp; At Yarmouth he came almost immediately under the
magic spell of Wales again.&nbsp; The unpublished manuscript of
&ldquo;The Sleeping Bard&rdquo; could not be allowed to slumber
any longer, and he determined to issue the book at his own
expense.&nbsp; Murray made a graceful compromise; though he would
not undertake the publication, he allowed Borrow to use his
valuable imprint, so that 250 copies were turned out by Denew the
printer of Yarmouth, with the notification on the title-page that
the book was published by John Murray.&nbsp; Apparently Borrow
came to the conclusion that if Elis Wyn was to be reviewed
adequately, he must do it himself.&nbsp; In the <i>Quarterly
Review</i> for January, 1861, appeared an anonymous article on
&ldquo;The Welsh and their Literature.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the
sprites which inhabited Borrow&rsquo;s portfolios knew that the
main part of this article had been there for many years.&nbsp; It
appeared in the <i>Quarterly</i>, polished up, and interleaved
with references to the translation of the &ldquo;Bardd
Cwsg.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was admired by those who were interested in
the subject, and they were at any rate sufficiently numerous to
buy up the whole edition of Elis Wyn in a month.&nbsp; The book
was held in very favourable opinion by Welshmen.&nbsp; This was
the last literary work of any sort he did in East Anglia, to
which he was shortly to bid farewell for fourteen years.</p>
<p>Borrow and his wife departed from Yarmouth at the end of June,
1860, and took lodgings at No. 21, <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>Montagu Street, Portman
Square.&nbsp; The special reason for their residence in the East
of England had vanished with the death of his mother, and they
had been discussing for some time the project of taking a house
in London.&nbsp; There he counted upon closer touch with the
literary world.&nbsp; In a sense, he obtained it, for he was in
constant companionship with a few choice friends; but for the
purposes of a biographer the removal to town was
disastrous.&nbsp; After the first year or two he made no
conspicuous figure in literature, his correspondence almost
ceased, and the records of his movements first become scanty and
then vanish altogether.&nbsp; They are to be found in casual
references among the reminiscences of the limited circle of his
associates&mdash;Frances Power Cobbe, Charles Godfrey Leland, and
Theodore Watts-Dunton.&nbsp; And, with the last name excepted, it
is no very prepossessing picture that we get of him.&nbsp; Miss
Clarke had been left at Oulton during the period of
house-hunting.&nbsp; She joined them after they had taken No. 22,
Hereford Square, Brompton, where they had Miss Cobbe for a near
neighbour.</p>
<p>Having installed his household gods there, Borrow began to
occupy himself with the most congenial employments he could
discover.&nbsp; There was &ldquo;Wild Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
beloved book was on the stocks; it was being worked up with the
affection he bestowed on no other subject.&nbsp; But he did not
permit it to absorb him.&nbsp; There were many things to be done
in <a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>London by a lover of common adventures and a student of
social byways.&nbsp; There were rambles in the streets and in the
environs of London, where odd characters were far more numerous
than in East Anglia, or Wales, or Cornwall.&nbsp; There were
gypsies&mdash;degenerate gypsies who lived in houses, still more
degenerate gypsies who plied petty commerce in caravans, and the
remnants of the real blood who camped in the outskirts of the
metropolis, and were not unwilling to converse with &ldquo;the
London caloro&rdquo; when he found his way among them.&nbsp;
There was an occasional race; there was an occasional
fight.&nbsp; A foot race at Brompton between
&ldquo;Deerfoot,&rdquo; the Seneca Indian, and Jackson,
&ldquo;the American deer,&rdquo; in October, 1861, was the
subject of a lively description in his notebook.</p>
<p>Borrow tried some of his friends a good deal, even now that he
was mellowing.&nbsp; But he had not lost the art of being jovial,
and there are records of festivities at which he very
successfully entertained those whom he might call his
&ldquo;pals.&rdquo;&nbsp; Richmond was a favourite resort.&nbsp;
One dinner party at the Star and Garter, when Borrow was host,
comprised John Murray, his partner Cooke, and his brother-in-law,
Dr. David Smith, of Edinburgh.&nbsp; It was a gargantuan feast
for that day; it cost Borrow &pound;6 3s., of which &pound;4 1s.
6d. was for wine.&nbsp; His studies in the poetry of many lands
went on concurrently with his entertainments and his work on
Wales.&nbsp; The habit <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>of translation was ingrained, and
could not be conquered.&nbsp; He continued turning poems and
legends into English from the Celtic tongues, from Danish,
Turkish, and Russian.&nbsp; But no book came of all this
industry.&nbsp; The public were still callously indifferent to
Borrow&rsquo;s poetical versions, as they had been in other
years.&nbsp; They had put up with some of Bowring&rsquo;s
anthologies, but had now tired even of his Magyars and
Serbs.&nbsp; The prevailing sentiment about this kind of literary
ware was represented by a ludicrous parody which appeared in
<i>Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine</i>:</p>

<p>The utmost Borrow could do was to induce the editor of <i>Once
a Week</i>&mdash;which had just entertained a very different kind
of angel unawares in the person of George Meredith&mdash;to
publish a series of ballads and stories from the Manx, Russian,
Danish, and old Norse.</p>
<p>But in 1862 occurred a literary event whose importance was
very slowly realised.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wild Wales&rdquo;
appeared.&nbsp; Its reception by the critics was exceedingly <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>curious.&nbsp; Most of the newspapers ignored it
altogether; others were unjust to the point of savagery.&nbsp;
For concentrated malice, the <i>Cornhill</i> notice would be
difficult to surpass.&nbsp; &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; wrote the
reviewer (obviously as closely in touch with Borrow and his
subject as a cat with the differential calculus), &ldquo;it is
too much to demand that we should read the record of every glass
of ale which Mr. Borrow drank&mdash;usually with his criticism of
its quality&mdash;or be patient under the fatiguing triviality
of, &lsquo;I paid my bill and departed,&rsquo; which occurs
incessantly.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, lest it should be imagined that
Borrow was either drinking beer or paying hotel bills all the
time he was in Wales, the reviewer went on grudgingly to admit
that &ldquo;snatches of commonplace conversation and intensely
prosaic translations of Welsh-poems swell out this book and
render it rather tiresome reading.&rdquo;&nbsp; At least one
notice was both fair and complimentary, and foreshadowed the very
high opinion in which the book is held at the present day by
Welshmen.&nbsp; That was the article in the <i>Spectator</i>,
which described it as &ldquo;the first really clever book we
remember to have seen in which an honest attempt is made to do
justice to the Welsh literature. . . .&nbsp; In the course of his
wanderings Mr. Borrow caught very happily the salient points in
the Welsh character, and he has depicted them with those light,
free touches which none but George Borrow can hit off to such
perfection.&rdquo;&nbsp; True, the <a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span><i>Spectator</i> discovered
&ldquo;the fine Roman hand&rdquo; of Mr. Borrow in some of the
speeches of his friends, but felt sure that the conversations
were in substance faithfully recorded.</p>
<p>Borrow was in his sixtieth year when &ldquo;Wild Wales&rdquo;
was published.&nbsp; In spite of the extraordinary extent and
variety of his activities, he was by no means an old man.&nbsp;
He retained his physical vigour; his mental force was
unimpaired.&nbsp; He was to have twenty years more of life in
which to accumulate new experiences and contract a rare
friendship or two.&nbsp; Yet he had certainly outgrown his
vogue.&nbsp; The older public that had hailed some of his writing
with demonstrative joy had gone; he had not found&mdash;nor was
to find while he lived&mdash;the newer public that could enter
into the spirit in which he did his work.&nbsp; It is a little
disconcerting, but not really a matter for surprise, that after
the publication of &ldquo;Wild Wales&rdquo; Borrow gradually sank
out of view.&nbsp; He buried himself still deeper in his
philological studies.&nbsp; At intervals he vanished from London
to make tours in various parts of the British Islands.&nbsp;
Rough notes of these may be consulted in Knapp; they were never
polished into anything like literary form.&nbsp; In 1865 came
another severance: Miss Clarke, his step-daughter, married Dr.
William MacOubrey, and went to live at Belfast.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;old Hen&rdquo; of Borrow&rsquo;s letters, the
&ldquo;Henrietta&rdquo; of &ldquo;Wild Wales,&rdquo; had been a
member of his household ever since the golden days <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>of sunny
Seville, and he had a very deep and sincere affection for
her.&nbsp; He did not, of course, feel the separation so acutely
as did his wife, who had never parted from her for more than a
few weeks at a time during the forty-seven years since she was
born; and it was Mrs. Borrow who planned a visit to the Orange
capital in the following year.&nbsp; She was escorted to Belfast
by her husband, who left her there with Mrs. MacOubrey, while he
went off to Scotland.&nbsp; Crossing to Stranraer, he set out
upon a lonely tramp in the Lowlands and the Border Country.&nbsp;
He visited Abbotsford, but, his rage against Sir Walter Scott
having subsided, his notes are as mild as a guidebook.&nbsp;
Pushing on to Edinburgh, he returned to Glasgow by rail, and took
the steamer to Belfast, spending the remaining weeks of the
holiday in Ulster, with pedestrian trips to Lisburn and
Antrim.</p>
<p>The journey through the Border was not without some literary
fruit, as will be seen.&nbsp; For some years Borrow had been
absorbed in Welsh and Danish poetry; but just now his attention
was returning to the gypsy friends of his youth.&nbsp; At Kirk
Yetholm, a few miles south-east of Kelso, dwelt Esther Blyth, the
descendant of a famous gypsy king, herself endowed with a royal
title, &ldquo;the Queen of the Nokkums.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her majesty
was sought out and &ldquo;interviewed,&rdquo; and the notes of
this encounter were worked into a chapter of the last book Borrow
ever wrote.</p>
<h2><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">DEATH OF MRS. BORROW</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the visit to Belfast Mrs.
Borrow had been unwell, and her ill-health was her
husband&rsquo;s principal cause of anxiety for the following
three years.&nbsp; In 1867 they visited Bognor, where she was
revivified by the sea breezes, while he made tours through
Hampshire and the New Forest.&nbsp; The next year complications
arose in the administration of the Oulton estate, and they had to
go into Norfolk to extricate the business.&nbsp; On their return,
Mrs. Borrow failed rapidly.&nbsp; Weakened by heart disease and
dropsy, and worried by the prospect of litigation with a
neighbour, her illness took a serious form, and threw Borrow into
a state of melancholy in which &ldquo;the Horrors&rdquo; attacked
him, as we find by a reference in Miss Cobbe&rsquo;s
autobiography.&nbsp; She speaks of having one night
&ldquo;cheered him and sent him off quite brisk&rdquo; after a
bout of this kind, her method being to engage him in theological
argument &ldquo;in a serious way&rdquo;!&nbsp; He &ldquo;abounded
in my sense of the nonexistence of Hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the
processes by which they sought to remove Borrow&rsquo;s megrims
were original, the sympathy and solicitude of Miss Cobbe and Miss
<a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>Lloyd
were unfailing.&nbsp; But none of the cares of friendship, no
effort on Borrow&rsquo;s part, could avail to stave off the
disaster that approached.&nbsp; His wife grew worse, and on
January 30th, 1869, succumbed to an aggregation of maladies, just
in time to obviate the necessity (foreshadowed by Dr. Playfair,
who was called in at the end) of sequestration because of mental
affliction.</p>
<p>Thus sadly closed the long partnership of thirty years so
romantically begun at Seville in &ldquo;a dream of sunshine and
shade, of falling water and flowers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Borrow had
reached the age of seventy-three, and was seven years older than
her husband.&nbsp; His grief was terrible.&nbsp; He had lost her
who had been in literal fact his better half, who had inspired
his courage and fought his &ldquo;Horrors&rdquo; for him, had
organised his business, and had been wife and friend, counsellor
and physician, amanuensis and private secretary rolled into
one.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor old Borrow is in a sad state,&rdquo; wrote
Miss Cobbe.&nbsp; In his distraught condition friendliness
suffered.&nbsp; He hesitated to &ldquo;trouble anyone with his
sorrows&rdquo; and, when over-persuaded to dine out, was
melancholy, &ldquo;so cross so <i>rude</i>,&rdquo; as said Miss
Cobbe on one occasion.&nbsp; Her narrative of the attempts she
made to drag him out of himself is luminous with
humour&mdash;conscious and unconscious.&nbsp; There was much
innocent malice in the fashion in which she set her superior
knowledge of Norse lore against his, parrying his Firbolgs with
<a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>her
Keatinge, and his Tuatha-de-Danaan with her Hakon of
Norway.&nbsp; But she did not perceive that the most humorous
thing of all was the fact that she should attempt to raise a
bereaved man out of his despair by touching him in his most
tender intellectual spots.</p>
<p>For a year after the death of his wife Borrow buried himself
in books&mdash;out-of-the-way books, archaic books, as
usual.&nbsp; Drake&rsquo;s &ldquo;Historia Anglo-Scotica&rdquo;
figures in the list.&nbsp; He declared to Miss Cobbe that he had
read no modern writer since Scott.&nbsp; This was not literally
accurate.&nbsp; He had read and admired Dickens, for, in a letter
to Luis de Us&oacute;z, he spoke of him as &ldquo;a second
Fielding . . . who, in certain novels founded on life in London
and the provinces, as displayed in every grade of society from
the lowest to the highest, has evinced such talent, such humour,
variety and profound knowledge of character, that he charms his
readers&mdash;at least, those that have the capacity to
comprehend him. . . .&nbsp; Read, as soon as you can, all the
writings of &lsquo;Boz,&rsquo; and I am sure you will thank me
all your life for having disclosed to you a mine of such
delectable reading.&rdquo; <a name="citation241"></a><a
href="#footnote241" class="citation">[241]</a>&nbsp; His opinion
of Scott had undergone considerable modification since the days
of the Appendix and
&ldquo;Charlie-o&rsquo;er-the-Waterism,&rdquo; for he said that
&ldquo;Scott <i>was greater than Homer</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; (The
italics and the note of astonishment are Miss Cobbe&rsquo;s.)</p>
<p><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>Another sweeping dictum of his on the same occasion was
that the Norse stories were &ldquo;far grander than the
Greek.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Borrow was addicted to impulsive
generalisations, and we need pay no more special attention to
these judgments promulgated in Hereford Square than to the
declarations made at various times that Gronwy Owen&rsquo;s
account of the toppling down of the crag of Snowdon on the
Judgment Day was better than anything in Homer, that Horace and
Martial were not superior to Ab Gwilym, and that Huw Morris was
the finest lyrical poet of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Not long after these passages at arms with Miss Cobbe, he was
suddenly plunged again into the old romantic interest of
gypsyism.&nbsp; Towards the end of 1870 he received a letter from
C. G. Leland, who had then been about eighteen months in England,
and was pursuing his studies of the English gypsies on more
scientific and more thorough lines than Borrow had ever
adopted.&nbsp; No two men were farther apart in literary
characteristics than Borrow and Leland.&nbsp; The author of the
&ldquo;Hans Breitmann&rdquo; ballads is far better known to the
larger world as a writer of comic verse than as a student of
languages and folklore.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hans Breitmann&rsquo;s
Barty&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ping-Wing, the Pieman&rsquo;s Son&rdquo;
are in everybody&rsquo;s mouth; &ldquo;The English Gypsies and
their Language&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Gypsy Sorcery&rdquo; are
familiar mainly to the elect.&nbsp; The humour of Borrow and that
of Leland are of <a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>widely different character.&nbsp; Leland&rsquo;s gay
spirit lights a lamp of jocund fancy; Borrow&rsquo;s humour is
elemental, and, when his art adds quality to it, the quality is
sardonic.&nbsp; Yet these two were attuned in a remarkable way,
and on the subject of gypsyism and philology their tastes were in
common.&nbsp; Borrow&mdash;leaving out of account a little
natural jealousy&mdash;could hardly fail to be attracted to the
man who was to write so vividly later of his intimacy with all
&ldquo;the lords and earls of Little Egypt&rdquo; in the south of
England, and of those sojourns in the tents which involved
&ldquo;a great deal of strangely picturesque rural life,
night-scenes by firelight, in forests and by river banks, and
marvellously odd reminiscences of other days.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
there were other interests held by both&mdash;for Leland was a
Celtic scholar; did he not &ldquo;discover&rdquo; Shelta, and
know all about the olden men, who</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . . sat with ghosts on a stormy shore<br
/>
And spoke in a tongue men speak no more&rdquo;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leland told Borrow in his first letter that he was a lover of
his books, and had read them all five times, with the exception
of &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wild Wales,&rdquo;
which he had only read once.&nbsp; He had been seeking in vain
for some mutual friend to introduce them, and now put himself
forward modestly as the author of &ldquo;a collection of ballads
satirising Germany and the Germans, under the title of
&lsquo;Hans Breitmann.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow wrote giving an
<a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>invitation.&nbsp; Leland acknowledged it in a charming
letter, announcing that he had asked his publishers to send
Borrow copies of &ldquo;Breitmann&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Music
Lesson of Confucius.&rdquo;&nbsp; The former was offered as an
oblation to the gypsy gods; it contained a ballad &ldquo;written
by myself in the German Romany jib . . . which I would gladly
learn from yourself whether it be worth anything or
not.&rdquo;&nbsp; The second was a delicate compliment to Borrow,
for in it was a poem &ldquo;suggested by a passage in &lsquo;The
Romany Rye,&rsquo; referring to the melancholy Sven Vonved, the
Northern Sphynx, who went about giving out riddles and gold
rings.&rdquo;&nbsp; Leland ran on about gypsies and the Romany
tongue, tinkers and rat-catchers, horses and hunting, in his
inimitable way, declaring, &ldquo;My dear Mr. Borrow, for all
this you are entirely responsible.&nbsp; More than twenty years
ago your books had an incredible influence on me, and now you see
the results.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the meeting which followed, Leland told Borrow that he was
preparing a work on the English gypsies, and it is fairly clear
that this fact induced Borrow to write his own last book,
&ldquo;The Romano Lavo-Lil,&rdquo; or Word-Book of the
Gypsies.&nbsp; There have been found even Borrovians to regret
that this book was ever published.&nbsp; Most of the criticism
lavished upon it is no doubt justified.&nbsp; It is quite as
unscientific, quite as useless as a lexicon, as its assailants
said.&nbsp; Its miscellaneous contents are not to be compared for
vigour and interest with his earlier <a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>work.&nbsp; But the true lover of
Borrow would not have it absent from the little shelf which holds
his books, even if it were only for the tale of Ryley Bosvil, and
the interview with Esther Blyth&mdash;a reminiscence of his visit
to Kirk Yetholm to see the &ldquo;Queen of the Nokkums&rdquo;
during the Border tour.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Romano Lavo-Lil&rdquo;
did not appear, however, till 1874.&nbsp; In the meantime, he
edited a third edition of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Romany Rye,&rdquo; in one volume each, for Murray (1872), and
recast his translation of the Gospel of Luke in the Calo.</p>
<p>An acquaintance he formed during the late years of his London
life was that of Mr. William Mackay, who subsequently went to
live at Oulton Broad.&nbsp; Mr. Mackay has related one or two
anecdotes spiced with a very piquant frankness, for he is
apparently no worshipper of Borrow, and has taken pains to
dispute the claims advanced by those who are.&nbsp; He speaks of
one occasion when they went together to a tavern on the edge of a
great common, where Borrow called for &ldquo;swipes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This was the beerhouse title of the poorest kind of ale.&nbsp;
Mr. Mackay says that Borrow affected it because it was the drink
of his Romany friends.&nbsp; When he &ldquo;had taken a pull at
the pewter, he pointed out to me a yokel at the end of the
apartment.&nbsp; The foolish bumpkin was slumbering.&nbsp;
Borrow, in a stage whisper, gravely assured me that the man was a
murderer, and confided to me, with all the emphasis of honest
conviction, the scene and details <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>of his crime.&nbsp; Subsequently I
ascertained that the elaborate incidents and fine touches of
local colour were but the coruscations of a too vivid
imagination, and that the villain of the ale-house on the common
was as innocent as the author of &lsquo;The Romany
Rye.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; It may not unreasonably seem to
dispassionate persons that Borrow took a pull not only at the
pewter, but at his friend&rsquo;s leg as well.</p>
<p>But Mr. Mackay is able to throw an interesting light on one or
two facets of his character&mdash;notably on his love of pugilism
for its own sake.&nbsp; Outside Borrow&rsquo;s own books, I do
not know any sketch that gives a more living idea of his joy in
combat than this.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a fine thing,&rdquo; says
Mr. Mackay, &ldquo;to see the great man tackle a tramp.&nbsp;
Then he scented the battle from afar, bearing down on the enemy
with quivering nostril.&nbsp; If the nomad happened to be a
gypsy, he was courteously addressed; but if he were a mere native
tatterdemalion, inclined to be truculent, Borrow&rsquo;s coat was
off in a moment, and the challenge to decide there and then who
was the better man flung forth.&nbsp; I have never seen such
challenges accepted, for Borrow was robust and towering.&nbsp;
But those who have seen him &lsquo;put his dukes up&rsquo; affirm
that he gave an excellent account of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is also a glimpse in these notes <a
name="citation245"></a><a href="#footnote245"
class="citation">[245]</a> of Borrow&rsquo;s attitude towards the
great, though the story is not attested in any way and may be
merely <i>ben trovato</i>.&nbsp; <a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>When a member of the Russian Embassy
called on him in Hereford Square to request for his Imperial
master a copy of &ldquo;Targum,&rdquo; Borrow &ldquo;rudely told
the official to let his master fetch it himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most pregnant friendship of the later days remains to be
mentioned.&nbsp; Two souls of close affinity discovered each
other in 1872.&nbsp; In that year Borrow encountered Mr. Theodore
Watts.&nbsp; The fortunate fates threw these two men together:
Mr. Watts-Dunton, as we know him, has done more for the true
interpretation of Borrow than any other man.&nbsp; He brought to
the study of the Borrow books and the elucidation of the Borrow
character an intimate knowledge of the quaint things that Borrow
loved.&nbsp; He brought an extensive and peculiar acquaintance
with the tortuous paths in which Borrow roamed, whether they were
literary, or philological, or merely geographical.&nbsp; Nobody
has so deeply penetrated the Borrovian psychology; the pity of it
is that his criticism and appreciation are scattered through the
inaccessible files of journals and reviews, or appear as
&ldquo;introductions&rdquo; to various editions of Borrow&rsquo;s
works, and have never been collected.</p>
<p>The story of their meeting on the common ground of friendship
with Dr. Gordon Hake is, of course, familiar to all
Borrovians.&nbsp; It had results so wide, however, that some
account of it is due.&nbsp; For many years before the date
mentioned, Mr. Watts-Dunton, with his amour of <i>Natura
benigna</i>, his gypsyism, <a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>his cult of the open air, had
naturally been strongly drawn towards such a personality as
Borrow&rsquo;s, and had learnt to love his strange books.&nbsp;
He had seen the white-haired giant swimming in the sea off
Yarmouth, but had never spoken to him till the day at Gordon
Hake&rsquo;s house at Roehampton, when Borrow&rsquo;s approach,
&ldquo;striding across the common,&rdquo; was announced.&nbsp;
They got into touch with difficulty.&nbsp; Kindred spirits as
they were, Borrow&rsquo;s whimsies, his strangely mingled egoism
and shyness, placed obstacles in the way of sympathy.</p>
<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s account of the meeting is lit by a
mischievously flashing humour.&nbsp; It may be aptly compared
with Boswell&rsquo;s description of his introduction to Johnson
in the back parlour of Davies&rsquo;s shop, but it is far fuller
of humorous intent.&nbsp; He knew something of Borrow&rsquo;s
idiosyncrasies&mdash;his impatience of any learning that was not
in his own &ldquo;line,&rdquo; his touchiness about his own
books, his objection to inquiries into his relations with the
gypsies.&nbsp; A way of approach was gradually discovered in the
pamphlet literature of the eighteenth century, in which both were
highly cultured.&nbsp; Bampfylde Moore Carew did not yield much,
for Borrow &ldquo;evidently considered that every properly
educated man ought to be familiar with the story of Bampfylde
Moore Carew in its every detail.&rdquo;&nbsp; Beer, bruising,
gentility, languages were no more successful.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
tried other subjects in the same direction, but with small
success, till in a <a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>lucky moment I bethought myself of Ambrose
Gwinett.&nbsp; There is a very scarce eighteenth-century pamphlet
narrating the story of Ambrose Gwinett, the man who, after having
been hanged and gibbeted for murdering a traveller with whom he
had shared a double-bedded room at a seaside inn, revived in the
night, escaped from the gibbet-irons, went to sea as a common
sailor, and afterwards met on a British man-of-war the very man
he had been hanged for murdering.&nbsp; The truth was that
Gwinett&rsquo;s supposed victim, having been seized on the night
in question with a violent bleeding at the nose, had risen and
left the house for a few minutes&rsquo; walk in the sea breeze,
when the pressgang captured him and carried him off to sea, where
he had been in service ever since.&nbsp; I introduced the subject
of Ambrose Gwinett, and Douglas Jerrold&rsquo;s play upon it, and
at once the ice between us thawed, and we became
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have to thank Ambrose Gwinett and the gypsies on Wimbledon
Common for many charming additions to the literature of
Borrow.&nbsp; Hard upon this conversation came the first of those
walks in Richmond Park which Mr. Watts-Dunton has described with
so much felicity.&nbsp; It included that call at the Bald-faced
Stag in Kingston Vale, <a name="citation248"></a><a
href="#footnote248" class="citation">[248]</a> in order that <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>Borrow
might show his companion Jerry Abershaw&rsquo;s sword.&nbsp; It
was the occasion of the rainbow whose &ldquo;triumphal
arch&rdquo; filled the sky, when Borrow explained the gypsy
mystery of the trus&rsquo;hul, how, by making a cross of two
sticks, the expert in occultism could wipe the rainbow out of the
heavens. <a name="citation249"></a><a href="#footnote249"
class="citation">[249]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Watts-Dunton quaintly
discusses the question whether Borrow was &ldquo;a true child of
the open air,&rdquo; and comes to the conclusion that the man who
stood looking at the deer and the herons in Richmond Park, what
time he carried under his arm a huge, bulging, green gamp, was
not one of those who, &ldquo;owing to some exceptional power or
some exceptional infirmity,&rdquo; can get closer to Nature than
to brother, sister, wife, or friend.&nbsp; The inquisitiveness of
the man of science prevents this familiarity; so does
&ldquo;sensivity to human contact,&rdquo; as in the case of Emily
Bront&euml;; so does subjection to the love passion.&nbsp; It was
neither science nor passion that prevented Borrow from
matriculating in the University of the Open Air in the sense that
Thoreau did.&nbsp; It was Ambition.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His books show that he could never cleanse
his stuffed bosom of the perilous stuff of ambition.&nbsp; To
become renowned, <a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>judging from many a peroration in his books, was as
great an incentive . . . to learn languages as to Alexander
Smith&rsquo;s poet-hero it was an incentive to write poetry. . .
.&nbsp; But I soon found that if he was not a perfect Child of
the Open Air&mdash;he was something better: a man of that deep
sympathy with human kind which the Child of the Open Air must
needs lack.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was much talk during that ramble of the herons of
Whittlesea Mere&mdash;which Mr. Watts-Dunton identified as the
scene of some of the adventures in the early part of
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;&mdash;of viper-taming, of the East Anglian
gypsies, of horses (and especially of the descendants of
&ldquo;Shales&rdquo;), of the quality of the sea-water off the
east coast, and of like matters dear to the heart of
Borrow.&nbsp; The East Anglian in his new companion completely
conquered Borrow.&nbsp; They sang a duet in praise of the glassy
Ouse, which was the only river in England adequate to reflect the
rainbow, and of the wet sands of the Norfolk coast.&nbsp; The
last passage of the dialogue that Mr. Watts-Dunton has set down
is an amusing example of the complacency with which they agreed
on the superiority of East Anglia to any other spot under
heaven:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is on sand alone that the sea strikes
its true music&mdash;Norfolk sand; a rattle is not
music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best of the sea&rsquo;s lutes,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;is made by the sands of Cromer.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus was the entente ratified.&nbsp; It endured till Borrow
finally left London to end his days not far from the sound of the
sea&rsquo;s best lute.</p>

251</span>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE PASSING OF THE ROMANY RYE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> &ldquo;The Romano
Lavo-Lil&rdquo; came out at the beginning of 1874, the public
were already in possession of Leland&rsquo;s great book, which
finally &ldquo;queered the pitch&rdquo; for Borrow.&nbsp; The two
would not bear comparison as a study of the Romany language, for
Borrow had worked so hurriedly that his vocabulary was much less
complete than he might have made it.&nbsp; There are a large
number of gypsy words in various parts of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; which he failed to incorporate
in the new book; and others acquired at Yetholm were also
omitted.&nbsp; But it was not only in comparison with
Leland&rsquo;s that Borrow&rsquo;s last words on the gypsies
seemed feeble.&nbsp; Many much more learned persons had been
publishing monumental works on the subject&mdash;Pott, Miklosich,
Paspati, to mention only three.&nbsp; The new philological spirit
had been operating on the Romany; the gypsy tongue had been
treated with as much care and skill as though it were one of the
great literary languages; whereas, when &ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo;
was offered to the public, as Mr. Hindes Groome pointed out in
<i>The Academy</i>, &ldquo;there were not two educated men <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>in England
who possessed the slightest knowledge of Romany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Groome was fair, even generous, in some of his
acknowledgments.&nbsp; On the other hand, <i>The
Athen&aelig;um</i> had no bowels of compassion for the veteran;
it did not temper justice with mercy.&nbsp; Though it had to
confess that not a few of those who had studied the gypsies and
their language &ldquo;owed their first taste for the subject to
the perusal of Mr. Borrow&rsquo;s books,&rdquo; it could not
&ldquo;allow merely sentimental reasons to prevent us from
telling the honest truth,&rdquo; but forthwith told it in terms
of perfect candour.</p>
<p>Amidst this demonstration of the fact that he had outlived his
age, Borrow decided to leave London once and for all, and to
return to his home on the shores of Oulton Broad, where he was
finally lost to the sight of a world not patient of him.&nbsp; As
he told Mr. Watts-Dunton, he was going down into East Anglia to
die.&nbsp; For many years before the publication of his last
book, he had been very little in the limelight.&nbsp; The public
which had hailed &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; with almost
delirious delight had grown older.&nbsp; In the absence of
regular literary appeals to its attention by Borrow, it had
imagined him already dead.&nbsp; Some American celebrities at one
of Mrs. Procter&rsquo;s Sunday afternoons were discussing Borrow
and Latham with Mr. Watts-Dunton, who told them &ldquo;an
anecdote of a whimsical meeting&rdquo; between these two.&nbsp;
<a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>Was it
the computation of his capacity for &ldquo;bottles at a
sitting&rdquo; which Latham endeavoured to get out of Borrow at
Dr. Gordon Hake&rsquo;s?&nbsp; &ldquo;My anecdote,&rdquo; adds
Watts-Dunton, &ldquo;was fully appreciated and enjoyed by my
auditors till I chanced to let fall the fact that both heroes of
the quaint adventure were still alive, that they occasionally met
at Putney, and that I had quite lately been seeking for sundews
on Wimbledon Common with the one and strolling through Richmond
Park with the other.&nbsp; Then the look that passed from face to
face showed how dangerous it is to indulge on all occasions in
the coxcombry of mere truth.&nbsp; And afterwards my brilliant
hostess did not fail to let me know how grievously my character
for veracity had suffered for having talked about two men as
being alive who were well known to have been dead years
ago&mdash;&lsquo;talked of them as though I had just left them at
luncheon.&rsquo;&nbsp; And yet at this very time Latham and
Borrow were, in the eyes of a few of England&rsquo;s most
illustrious men, the important names they had always been.&rdquo;
<a name="citation253"></a><a href="#footnote253"
class="citation">[253]</a></p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s leave-taking of London had its apotheosis from
the same pen in a brilliant and much-quoted passage:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The last time I ever saw George Borrow was
shortly before he left London to live in the country.&nbsp; It
was, I remember well, on Waterloo Bridge, where I had stopped to
gaze at a sunset of singular and striking splendour, whose
gorgeous clouds and ruddy mists were reeling and boiling <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>over the
West End.&nbsp; Borrow came up and stood leaning over the
parapet, entranced by the sight, as well he might be.&nbsp; Like
most people born in flat districts, he had a passion for
sunsets.&nbsp; Turner could not have painted that one, I think,
and certainly my pen could not describe it; for the London smoke
was flushed by the sinking sun and had lost its dunness, and,
reddening every moment as it rose above the roofs, steeples, and
towers, it went curling round the sinking sun in a rosy vapour,
leaving, however, just a segment of a golden rim, which gleamed
as dazzlingly as in the thinnest and clearest air&mdash;a
peculiar effect which struck Borrow deeply.&nbsp; I never saw
such a sunset before or since, not even on Waterloo Bridge; and,
from its association with &lsquo;the last of Borrow,&rsquo; I
shall never forget it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Mr. Watts-Dunton paid tribute to Borrow of a sonnet
melodising their talk of the &ldquo;Children of the Open
Air,&rdquo; and making contrast of the lot of lovers of the sun
and wind with the habitants of London:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . . .&nbsp; Where men wither and
choke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Roofed in, poor souls, renouncing stars and
skies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And love of woods and wild-wind prophecies&mdash;<br
/>
Yea, every voice that to their father spoke;<br />
And sweet it seemed to die ere bricks and smoke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave never a meadow, outside Paradise.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the age of seventy-one there was not much left for the
solitary spirit to achieve.&nbsp; It was not easy to make new
friendships, and even the old ones were difficult to nurture at
Oulton.&nbsp; He made one effort to get Edward FitzGerald over
from Woodbridge to see him.&nbsp; FitzGerald, twenty years
before, had been an ardent admirer of Borrow&rsquo;s work.&nbsp;
Sending him a copy of his translation of Calderon&rsquo;s plays,
he remarked <a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>that he was a man &ldquo;who both did fine things in
his own language and was deep read in those of
others.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their correspondence was not extensive, but
FitzGerald&rsquo;s letters are of considerable interest.&nbsp;
For example, they show that Borrow was in the secret of old
Omar.&nbsp; FitzGerald wrote that &ldquo;Cowell, to whom I sent a
copy, was naturally alarmed at it, he being a very religious man;
nor have I given any other copy but to George Borrow . . . and to
old Donne . . .&rdquo; <a name="citation255"></a><a
href="#footnote255" class="citation">[255]</a>&nbsp; This was a
copy of the edition printed in 1859 by Quaritch.&nbsp; But two
years before the premature birth of the great poem, FitzGerald
had lent Borrow his manuscript of the quatrains, and in asking
for the return of it, he wrote: &ldquo;I only want a look at him.
. . .&nbsp; You shall have <i>Omar</i> back directly, or whenever
you want him, and I should really like to make you a copy (taking
my time) of the best quatrains.&nbsp; I am now looking over the
Calcutta manuscript, which has 500!&mdash;very many quite as good
as those in the manuscript you have; but very many in <i>both</i>
manuscripts are well omitted. . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; FitzGerald had
been at Oulton about 1850.&nbsp; In 1856 he had visited Borrow
again at Yarmouth, and of that meeting he says expressively,
&ldquo;I enjoyed my evening.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not fail, of
course, to rub against some of Borrow&rsquo;s angles.&nbsp;
According to Mr. Benson (&ldquo;Edward FitzGerald,&rdquo; in the
&ldquo;English Men of Letters&rdquo; series), he &ldquo;found
this strange pilgrim&rsquo;s <a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>masterful manners and irritable
temper uncongenial,&rdquo; but Mr. Benson admits that FitzGerald
said, long afterwards, &ldquo;he was almost the only friend
Borrow had never quarrelled with.&rdquo;&nbsp; The irritation
could have been but slight, if it could be called irritation at
all: in one of his wayward moods Borrow banged home the covers of
the book just as his guest was about to ask him to read some of
the Northern Ballads.&nbsp; This incident is mentioned without
rancour by FitzGerald, in a letter in which he makes Borrow a
present of Redhouse&rsquo;s &ldquo;New Turkish Dictionary,&rdquo;
declares what a pleasant evening he had spent at Yarmouth, and
lets his friend into the secret of his amazing marriage.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I must tell you.&nbsp; I am come up
here&rdquo; (he writes from London) &ldquo;on my way to
Chichester to be&mdash;married! to Miss Barton (of Quaker
memory), and our united ages amount to 96!&mdash;a dangerous
experiment on both sides.&nbsp; She at least brings a fine head
and heart to the bargain&mdash;worthy of a better market.&nbsp;
But it is to be, and I dare say you will honestly wish we may do
well.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;dangerous experiment&rdquo; turned out as we
know.&nbsp; FitzGerald&rsquo;s letter is hardly that of a man who
found Borrow &ldquo;uncongenial.&rdquo;&nbsp; He liked the Borrow
<i>m&eacute;nage</i>, they had much in common in their literary
tastes, and some few common friends&mdash;Donne for one, and for
another Kerrich, of Geldeston Hall, FitzGerald&rsquo;s
brother-in-law.&nbsp; He liked Borrow&rsquo;s books, too.&nbsp;
They were among the few modern works he read, though his
fastidious palate was offended by some of Borrow&rsquo;s <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>lapses in
style.&nbsp; In addition to the meetings at Oulton and Yarmouth,
there were foregatherings at Donne&rsquo;s house in London, at
FitzGerald&rsquo;s own house in Great Portland Street, and at
Gorleston.</p>
<p>But this was all twenty years old now; the FitzGerald who
received Borrow&rsquo;s letter at Woodbridge was sixty-six and a
close recluse, unable to understand why any man who had reached
his age or gone beyond it should want any company but his
own.&nbsp; His response is a curious illustration of the hermit
way of thought into which he had fallen.&nbsp; He told Borrow
that for the last fifteen years he had not visited any of his
oldest friends, except the daughters of George
Crabbe&mdash;&ldquo;my old parson Crabbe,&rdquo; vicar of
Bredfield, whose &ldquo;brave old white head&rdquo; had
&ldquo;sunk into the village churchsward&rdquo; in 1857&mdash;and
Donne, to whom he had given a half-day.&nbsp; To have told why he
had thus fallen from his company would have been a tedious thing,
he said, and all about himself, too&mdash;&ldquo;whom, Montaigne
says, one never talks about without detriment to the person
talked about.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One&rsquo;s friends, however kind and
&lsquo;loyal&rsquo; (as the phrase goes), do manage to exist and
enjoy themselves pretty reasonably without one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So with me.&nbsp; And is it not much the same with you
also?&nbsp; Are you not glad now to be mainly alone, and find
company a heavier burden than the grasshopper? . . .&nbsp; I like
to think over my old friends.&nbsp; They are there, lingering <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>as
ineffaceable portraits&mdash;done in the prime of life&mdash;in
my memory.&nbsp; Perhaps we should not like one another so well
after a fifteen years&rsquo; separation, when all of us change
and most of us for the worse. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;So shall things rest?&nbsp; I could not go to you,
after refusing all this while to go to older&mdash;if not
better&mdash;friends. . . .&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter, dated January 10th, 1875, is almost the final
literary relic of Borrow.&nbsp; It sings in a minor key, but with
a fitting sombre melody, the requiem of his career in the world
of letters.&nbsp; Borrow himself, however, did not renounce and
abhor society in FitzGerald&rsquo;s fashion.&nbsp; Desolate
Oulton, the haunt of so many wraiths of past joys and sorrows,
saddened the lonely old man, and in the late &rsquo;seventies he
lived a good deal in Norwich, where he had apartments in Lady
Lane, seeking the company of those who knew and liked him.&nbsp;
His favourite resort was the old Norfolk Hotel.&nbsp; There he
had his special chair, whence he issued his pronouncements <i>ex
cathedra</i> on ale and men and things.&nbsp; But to Oulton he
turned at the last, dismal as it was.&nbsp; The estate had been
pitifully neglected during his residence in London.&nbsp; The
Nemesis that dogged his steps as a landed proprietor had always
been the litigious tenant.&nbsp; There was one in possession of
the Hall Farm in 1878, when Dr. and Mrs. MacOubrey had left
London to live at Oulton, in order to bear Borrow company in his
declining days.&nbsp; This tenant, calling at the Cottage to
deliver an ultimatum about the need for <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>repairs,
became rude to Borrow, who fired up quite in his best style, and
declared, &ldquo;Sir, you came in by that door; you can go out by
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s predilection for the alehouse is beyond
question, whether it was in Norwich, or in London, or in
Wales.&nbsp; But it was probably not so overpowering as sometimes
has been represented.&nbsp; The misrepresentation is doubtless
his own fault in great measure, because of the literary emphasis
he laid upon the virtue of inns and their staple commodity.&nbsp;
We have observed how this affected one of the reviewers of
&ldquo;Wild Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; Legends grew up around a certain
inn at Oulton Broad, the Wherry Hotel.&nbsp; They were
inevitable.&nbsp; Because it was an inn and was near
Borrow&rsquo;s house, gossip assumed that he was a frequent
visitor and a bibulous.&nbsp; A sort of myth arose that it was
the scene of drinking bouts, where Borrow not only gratified his
own passion for quarrelling and fighting, but egged on others to
quarrel and fight.&nbsp; It has already been shown on good
evidence that he was personally temperate, if not abstemious, and
the known facts dispose of the idea that there was any excessive
drinking. <a name="citation259"></a><a href="#footnote259"
class="citation">[259]</a>&nbsp; But the stories gave occasion
for a correspondence in one of the London papers a few years ago,
when Mr. <a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>William Mackay was able to dismiss them by proving that
the Wherry Hotel was kept by one Mason during this period, and
that Mr. Mason averred that Borrow did not visit the house more
than twice, and that he had no recollection of the incidents so
vividly described.</p>
<p>Mr. William A. Dutt has given us a graphic little picture <a
name="citation260"></a><a href="#footnote260"
class="citation">[260]</a> of Borrow in the last years of his
life in the country of the Broads, and of the impression he made
on his neighbours:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His tall, erect, somewhat mysterious figure
was often seen in the early hours of summer mornings or late at
night on the lonely pathways that wind in and out from the banks
of Oulton Broad.&nbsp; He loved to be mysterious, and the village
children used to hush their voices and draw aside at his
approach.&nbsp; They looked upon him with fear and awe&mdash;for
had they not seen him stop and talk with the gypsies, who ran
away with little children?&nbsp; But in his heart Borrow was fond
of the little ones, though it amused him to watch the impression
his strange personality made upon them.&nbsp; Older people he
seldom spoke to when out on his solitary rambles; but sometimes
he would flash out such a glance from beneath his broad-brimmed
hat and shaggy eyebrows as would make timid country-folk hasten
on their way filled with vague thoughts and fears of the evil
eye. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, Borrow was not unpopular with the villagers, <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>many of
whom, long after his death, remembered little acts of kindness on
his part by which they had benefited.&nbsp; To the sick and
infirm he was always a good friend, though his almost invariable
remedy for all the ills that flesh is heir to were wine and
ale.&nbsp; He was exceedingly fond of animals, and nothing
aroused his wrath more than to see them badly treated. . .
.&nbsp; A favourite old cat that was ill crawled out of his house
to die in the garden hedge.&nbsp; Borrow no sooner missed the
poor creature than he went in search of it, and brought it
indoors in his arms.&nbsp; He then laid it down in a comfortable
spot, and sat and watched it till it was dead.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most old people incline to exaggerate their age after they
have passed the common span of life, and are offended if the
achievement of longevity is not accounted a meritorious
performance in them.&nbsp; Borrow was unconventional in this as
in all things.&nbsp; He resented references to his age.&nbsp; The
vicar of Lowestoft visited him at Oulton, and had a smooth and
delightful experience till he transgressed by asking the veteran
how old he was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Borrow
thunderously, &ldquo;I tell my age to no man!&rdquo;&nbsp; One of
his last bits of writing, in a tremulous hand, was a little
dissertation &ldquo;On People&rsquo;s Age,&rdquo; beginning:
&ldquo;Never talk to people about their age. . . .&nbsp;
Compliment a man of eighty-five on the venerableness of his
appearance, and he will shriek out, &lsquo;No more <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>venerable
than yourself,&rsquo; and will perhaps hit you with his
crutch.&rdquo; <a name="citation262"></a><a href="#footnote262"
class="citation">[262]</a></p>
<p>The forcible sentiment was that of a man whose mind was
stronger than his physical frame.&nbsp; Within a few months the
passing came.&nbsp; His death, by some strange fate, was as
secret as much of his life had been: he passed to the hidden
bourne unseen by any human eye; his last agony was even more
closely veiled than those years of his youth around which he had
diffused a mist as thick as the enchanted vapours raised by his
favourite magicians, the Firbolgs.</p>
<p>On July 26th, 1881, Dr. and Mrs. MacOubrey drove to Lowestoft
on business.&nbsp; Borrow was left alone in the house.&nbsp; When
they returned he lay dead.&nbsp; Censure passed upon his
step-daughter and her husband in connection with this incident is
ungenerous.&nbsp; They had cared for him so tenderly that it is
impossible to accuse them of any lack of affection.&nbsp; And
who, viewing George Borrow&rsquo;s life and character as a
rounded whole, would regard the circumstances of his death with
disapproval?&nbsp; So, seventy-eight years after the summer
evening when, at the &ldquo;beautiful little town in a certain
district of East Anglia, I first saw the light,&rdquo; he entered
into the Life Everlasting, not many miles away, alone in his
lonely house, with the fir trees whispering as his <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>spirit
departed, and the quiet water shimmering by the little
summer-house where that spirit had communed with its choicest
companions and accomplished its finest work.&nbsp; The body lay
silent there for several days:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That port which so majestic was and
strong,<br />
Loose, and deprived of vigour, stretched along:<br />
All withered, all discoloured, pale and wan . . .&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On August 4th it was conveyed to London, and laid with the
body of his wife in West Brompton Cemetery.</p>
<p>Borrow dead was Borrow forgotten until the afflation of a new
time breathed upon him, and his resurrection came.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;strange pilgrim&rsquo;s masterful manner and irritable
temper&rdquo; took their proper place in the background of the
picture; the real value of his pilgrimage was seen.&nbsp; A
finnicking age which emphasised his &ldquo;vulgarity&rdquo; had
ended, and another age had opened which was competent to approve
his realism and to appraise his art.&nbsp; Borrow took his
rightful niche among the immortals who have illuminated the human
comedy and sung the joys of earth.&nbsp; The inspiration of
Jasper Petulengro is the inspiration of the New Day:
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a wind on the heath, brother. . . .&nbsp;
Who would wish to die?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BORROW&rsquo;S GYPSYISM</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Borrow&rsquo;s</span> gypsyism was the
most important part of his literary stock-in-trade.&nbsp; What it
was worth, apart from its literary value, is a moot point.</p>
<p>Any writer who is not a deep gypsiologist must approach such a
question with diffidence.&nbsp; The consensus of opinion is all
that can be suggested.&nbsp; It is that Borrow was unscientific
both as a Romany linguist and as a student of Romany
history.&nbsp; His knowledge of this strange race, for whose
origin we go to the Hindu Kush and beyond, was empirical; so was
his acquaintance with the language they took with them all over
the world and preserved for so many years almost as inviolably
secret as the Etruscan mystery.&nbsp; He was an enthusiast, but
not a learned enthusiast, and his method did not lend itself to
thoroughness&mdash;like that of Mr. Sampson, for example, of whom
a gypsy warned his friends that he would &ldquo;cut the heart out
of your breast if he thought he&rsquo;d find a new word in
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s gypsy stories were not arranged
on the elaborate plan of Mr. Sampson&rsquo;s excursions into the
gypsy lore of Wales.&nbsp; Though he knew the
&ldquo;tinkler&rdquo; tribes intimately, it was left <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>for Leland,
long years afterwards, to discover that they had a language of
their own, which was not Romany, but Shelta, subsequently
identified with the secret medium of the ancient bards of
Ireland.&nbsp; Leland&rsquo;s discovery and the investigations of
Professor Kuno Meyer and Mr. Sampson, which traced Shelta back to
the Gaelic of ten centuries ago, surely form one of the great
romances of philology.&nbsp; Leland himself was surprised that
Borrow had not penetrated this mystery, because he had
&ldquo;specially cultivated tinkers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a chapter on this subject intended to form part of a book
on Shelta, never completed, Leland wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The first or second time I conversed with
Borrow was in the British Museum, where he was examining an old
Irish manuscript, and made the remark to me that he did not
believe there was a man now living who could really read such
works.&nbsp; But this Nestor of the Romany ryes, who was indeed a
man of marvellous attainments and real genius, was somewhat
touched with the common weakness of the old school, that he had
mastered many subjects.&nbsp; Thus he positively declared in his
&lsquo;Lavo-Lil&rsquo; that there are only twelve hundred
Anglo-Romany words, when in fact my own manuscript collection
actually contains between three and four thousand, all approved
as authentic by the late Professor E. H. Palmer.&nbsp; What
Borrow would have said had he been told that there were thousands
of tinkers now living who spoke the secret language of the
bards&mdash;which was probably that of the Druids&mdash;passes
conjecture.&rdquo; <a name="citation265"></a><a
href="#footnote265" class="citation">[265]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should certainly have had a tinker portrait as fine as that
of Murtagh, from whom Borrow learned <a name="page266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>the Irish Gaelic of ordinary
commerce.&nbsp; But it is idle to pursue the subject of
Borrow&rsquo;s empiricism.&nbsp; That is a matter which concerns
the experts of philology and not the wider world.&nbsp; The
important thing is the use which Borrow made of his gypsy
knowledge and the fascination he himself exercised over the
Romany chalu gypsy men.</p>
<p>While he often affected to approach the subject from the
scientist&rsquo;s point of view, and to lay the Romany language
on the dissecting table, what in actual fact attracted him was
the picturesque aspect of gypsy life.&nbsp; That is what attracts
his readers to-day.&nbsp; His books are fitting companions of the
pictures of David Cox and De Wint.&nbsp; Who, looking upon that
wonderful drawing by Cox of &ldquo;Gypsies Crossing a
Moor&rdquo;&mdash;a drawing so phenomenally realistic of the
effect of wind that the spectator is almost induced to turn up
his coat collar&mdash;does not recall the description in
&ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo; of &ldquo;the hurried march; the women
and children, mounted on lean but spirited asses, would scour
along the plains fleeter than the wind; ragged and savage-looking
men, wielding the scourge and goad, would scamper by their side
or close behind . . .&rdquo;?&nbsp; And there are a score of
scenes in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; to match the sketches made by De
Wint in his visits to the Romany tans (tents)&mdash;his glowing
yellows, his swarthy faces, and his romantic rags.</p>
<p>The point specially to be observed is that Borrow&rsquo;s <a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>vision of
the gypsy race in the early part of the nineteenth century is
practically the only one in existence.&nbsp; It has the value of
a record, in addition to the value of a picture.&nbsp; Though
there are great numbers of gypsies in the British islands, the
old order of society known to Borrow has largely broken up.&nbsp;
When he knew it, the organisation and status of that society had
been unaltered for centuries.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s gypsies were
as esoteric as they had been in 1550, when Andrew Borde, writing
his &ldquo;Fyrst Boke of the Introduction of Knowledge,&rdquo;
&ldquo;introduced&rdquo; as a great discovery a few sentences of
Romany, which he described as &ldquo;Egipt speche,&rdquo; and
drew an uncomplimentary character sketch of the &rsquo;Gyptians,
to whom he ascribed origin in the land of Rameses: &ldquo;The
people of the country be swarte, and doth go disgised in theyr
apparel contrary to other nacions, they be lyght fingerd and use
pyking [picking pockets], they have litle manner, and evyl
looking, and yet be pleasant dansers.&rdquo; <a
name="citation267"></a><a href="#footnote267"
class="citation">[267]</a>&nbsp; Even while Borrow&rsquo;s books
were appearing, however, the old gypsy society was
disappearing.&nbsp; The enclosure of the English commons had made
it hard for them to survive in their original state; the arrival
of the railway so altered the whole atmosphere and outlook of the
countryside that it became intolerable to them, <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>and vast
numbers of the wealthier class, the gryengroes or horse-dealers,
with whom Borrow consorted, left for a newer and more
simply-organised country on the other side of the Atlantic.&nbsp;
Those who remained deteriorated.&nbsp; Gypsy traditions
survive.&nbsp; So does the language.&nbsp; But the racial purity
has been to a great extent lost by intermarriage among the
gypsies, the &ldquo;tinklers,&rdquo; and the mumpers; and many of
the caravanners on the English roads to-day have very little
gypsy blood in their veins.&nbsp; How long any gypsyism at all
will combat the onslaughts of the law on the one hand and the
motor on the other is a doubtful point.&nbsp; There is a tendency
in the one case to impose conditions which make the nomadic life
almost impracticable; <a name="citation268"></a><a
href="#footnote268" class="citation">[268]</a> in the other case,
the caravan (in the gypsy sense) is seriously incommoded by the
speeding up of road traffic.</p>
<p>Borrow wrote in his autobiography about gypsies <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>as they
were in the days before education and petrol had combined against
them, when their camps were to be found in lonely lanes and
obscure dells, and they rested in the heat of noon by the green
roadside.&nbsp; The substantial accuracy of his picture has been
amply confirmed.&nbsp; He recorded facts about their habits and
their habitat.&nbsp; For some reason he was able to read more
deeply into their character than many observers who are not open
to the same charge of being unscientific.&nbsp; What he tells us
of gypsy pride, love of race, exclusiveness, mutual honour,
hostility to the gentiles, faithfulness to their own standards
amidst what seems to be degradation and squalor, is perfectly
true.&nbsp; It remains as true to-day, indeed, as it was when
Borrow wrote, wherever unadulterated gypsy blood is found.&nbsp;
He extenuated nothing.&nbsp; Complaint has been made that, on the
contrary, he failed to do justice to the better side of <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>the gypsy
woman&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; Mr. Watts-Dunton has pointed this
out; and it cannot be denied that the figures of Mrs. Herne and
Leonora are horrible enough, grotesquely villainous, and
compelling mainly by reason of the baneful magnetism of their
unequivocal wickedness.&nbsp; The companion portrait of Ursula
should not, however, be overlooked, nor that section of
&ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo; which he devotes to the vindication of
the gitanas&rsquo; chastity.</p>
<p>The charm exercised by the gypsies upon Borrow was so strong
that he said he did not remember the time when the mere mention
of the name failed to awaken within him feelings hard to be
described.&nbsp; He knew all the tribes of the East of England
from his boyhood&mdash;the Smiths, the Pinfolds, Grays,
Bosviles,&mdash;visited their camps, met them on Mousehold Heath,
admired their horse-craft, worshipped the pugilists among them,
followed them to fairs and studied their tricks and wiles, learnt
their language, and found his way into their confidence.&nbsp; It
could only be done because he worked spells upon them much as
they worked their enchantment upon him.&nbsp; The tall youth with
the white hair and the piercing eyes, who seemed to be more
absorbed in their saying and their doing than in any other
employment of his life, became one of them whenever he
pleased.&nbsp; They, indeed, refused to believe that one so
learned in their business was not one of them.&nbsp; Remarking on
the fact that in all his intercourse with the tribes in various
parts of the <a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>world he had never received the least injury from men
whose hatred and contempt of the &ldquo;gorgios&rdquo;
(&ldquo;gentiles,&rdquo; or non-gypsies) was inveterate, he said
he was &ldquo;not deceived as to the motive of their forbearance:
they thought him a Rom (<i>c.f.</i> page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page277">277</a></span>), and on
this supposition they hurt him not, their love of &lsquo;the
blood&rsquo; being their most distinguishing
characteristic.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the set of circumstances
which enabled Borrow to give us sketches of life and character as
fine as are to be found within any book-covers: the
masterly-limned portrait of Jasper Petulengro, quaintest and most
alluring of pagans, and the towering figure of Tawno Chikno, type
of gypsy beauty and chivalry.&nbsp; This vision of gypsydom in
England is one of Borrow&rsquo;s finest bequests to his
countrymen, if, indeed, its value is not greater than that of
anything else he accomplished.</p>
<p>In Spain he pursued the same road.&nbsp; He would turn aside
anywhere to talk with a gitano (gypsy), and the gypsy episodes
help to flush and enliven the pages of &ldquo;The Bible in
Spain&rdquo; in a very striking manner.&nbsp; The method he
adopted in compiling &ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo; has been remarked
in an earlier chapter.&nbsp; The reader who cares not at all for
Sancho de Moncada will yet find much in the book of curious
incident and lively observation.&nbsp; He who is bored to death
with Quinones may yet be interested in such a dramatic story as
that of the Bookseller of Logrono, and in such a graphic
description as that of the forge in the woods, <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>with its
gypsy metaphor of the sparks: &ldquo;More than a hundred lovely
daughters I see produced at one time, fiery as roses; in one
moment they expire, gracefully circumvolving.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he
tells us in &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; Borrow always saw poetry in a
forge.&nbsp; But just as he preferred Gronwy Owen to Homer, so he
set the vision of the gypsy smithy, under the trees of an English
dingle or in a Spanish forest, high above the more grandiose
forges of the classic shades in which</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . . the mighty family<br />
Of one-eyed brothers hasten to the shore,<br />
And gather round the bellowing Polypheme.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, he sometimes expressed downright contempt for Vulcan
and his minions, though he did not disdain the Cyclopean legend
as a literary element in the composition of the scene just
mentioned.&nbsp; The traditional trade of the smith is dying out
among the gypsies, and the sale of cheap tinpots is a much
commoner occupation of their lives than the forging of the petul
(horseshoe).&nbsp; Certain aspects of gypsydom described in
&ldquo;The Zincali,&rdquo; however, are constant, and here it is
proposed to notice more particularly Borrow&rsquo;s remarks
bearing on the general and permanent features of Romany character
and customs, arts and manners.</p>
<p>The attitude of the race towards questions of religion
interested him greatly.&nbsp; If their progenitors brought any
religion with them from beyond the frontier hills of India, they
had lost all trace of it <a name="page273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>before Western inquirers began to
investigate their history and explore their minds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you fear God, O Tu&eacute;rta?&rdquo; Borrow asked
the one-eyed daughter of P&eacute;pa the sybil in Madrid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother, I fear nothing!&rdquo; was
Tu&eacute;rta&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>He translated the Gospel of St. Luke into the gypsy language
of Spain, and remarks that the git&aacute;nos purchased it
freely; many of the men understood it, and prized it highly, but
they were induced &ldquo;more by the language than the
doctrine.&rdquo;&nbsp; The women, though generally unable to
read, &ldquo;each wished to have one in her pocket, especially
when engaged in thieving expeditions; for they all looked upon it
in the light of a charm which would preserve them from all danger
and mischance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having forgotten whatever gods they
ever worshipped before they left their country of origin, they
were perfectly indifferent to the Christianity of the Western
world.&nbsp; There is a curiously interesting passage on this
subject in the introductory chapters of &ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo;
dealing with the English gypsies:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With respect to religion, they call
themselves members of the Established Church, and are generally
anxious to have their children baptised and to obtain a copy of
the register.&nbsp; Some of their baptismal papers, which they
carry about with them, are highly curious, going back for a
period of upwards of two hundred years.&nbsp; With respect to the
essential points of religion, they are quite careless and
ignorant; if they believe in a future state, they dread it not,
and if they manifest when dying any anxiety, it is not for the
soul but for the body; a handsome coffin and a grave in a quiet
country <a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>churchyard are invariably the objects of their last
thoughts, and it is probable that, in their observance of the
rite of baptism, they are principally influenced by a desire to
enjoy the privilege of burial in consecrated ground.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This might hold as an accurate account of the gypsies of
to-day.&nbsp; In Eastern Europe, I believe, they are Christians
or Mussulmans with the greatest impartiality, and change from one
religion to the other as circumstances may require.&nbsp; In
Great Britain they like the distinction and the respectability
which they suppose to be attached to marriages and baptisms in
the Established Church.&nbsp; The ceremony of baptism is a
favourite one.&nbsp; They do not mind how many times or in how
many places they submit their children to that rite: the sponsors
usually give presents.&nbsp; The German gypsies who were in Great
Britain in 1906 had their children baptised in Glasgow.&nbsp; The
Catholic faith is professed by some Welsh members of the
race.&nbsp; But, in general, religion of any type has no relation
whatever to their lives; as a keen observer of the gypsies
remarked to the writer, &ldquo;they know as much about it as a
navvy does of bimetallism.&rdquo;&nbsp; They go to tea-meetings
which may be organised for their benefit, and behave themselves
as to the manner born; but efforts to evangelise them have been
of little permanent effect.&nbsp; They have no &ldquo;religious
sense&rdquo; in our acceptation of the term.&nbsp; Respect for
the dead, however, is still an essential article of the gypsy
code.</p>
<p><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>When
that rare old scoundrel Ryley Bosvil lay a-dying, as Borrow
relates in the &ldquo;Lavo-Lil,&rdquo; a Methodist visited him
and asked him what was his hope.&nbsp; &ldquo;My hope is,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;that when I am dead I shall be put into the
ground and my wife and children will weep over me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They did.&nbsp; And on the return from the grave they carried out
the gypsy custom, brought from India, of the funeral pyre.&nbsp;
Instead of quarrelling over the division of the property, like
Christians, as Borrow sourly says, they killed his pony and
buried it, smashed his caravan and cart into matchwood, and built
a fire, on which they cast his clothes, blankets, carpets, and
curtains; they broke his mirrors and his crockery, and battered
up his hardware, and threw it all on the flames.&nbsp; That
practice is still occasionally carried out in England: the
property of the dead shall not be defiled by the living.&nbsp;
And of the dead themselves they speak only with bated
breath.&nbsp; The relatives of a deceased gypsy will sometimes
give up his favourite food.&nbsp; &ldquo;An old friend of mine .
. . gave up fish when her husband died, because it was the last
thing they had eaten together,&rdquo; writes to me one who has an
intimate knowledge of the race.&nbsp; The old love for graves in
quiet little churchyards survives in Wales, but in
England&mdash;at any rate in Lancashire&mdash;the gypsies now own
graves in the big cemeteries.&nbsp; This is also the case in
France.&nbsp; In Norway, it is said, nobody knows how they
dispose of their dead.</p>

<p><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>In
&ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo; Borrow has a short disquisition on
gypsy law, which he analyses under three heads: (1) Separate not
from the husbands; (2) Be faithful to the husbands; (3) Pay your
debts to the husbands&mdash;the husband being the
&ldquo;Rom,&rdquo; as distinct from the &ldquo;gorgio,&rdquo; or
gentile.&nbsp; He contends that, whatever may be the moral and
legal relations between gypsydom and the world at large, there is
perfect honour amongst the members of the race itself.&nbsp; He
enlarges on the chastity of gypsy women, which is never overcome,
in whatever licentious scenes they may be involved.&nbsp; Experts
in the Romany language take exception to the use of the
expression &ldquo;husbands&rdquo; in Borrow&rsquo;s sense.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Rom&rdquo; is an obscure word, and &ldquo;husband&rdquo;
is only a secondary meaning.&nbsp; Its Indian origin is
uncertain; there are in Western Asia thousands of people who call
themselves &ldquo;Rom&rdquo; and are not gypsies.&nbsp; But
Borrow&rsquo;s rendering of the principles of gypsy law is
accurate.&nbsp; Clan attachment is all-powerful still.&nbsp; Mr.
Scott-Macfie informs me of the case of two brothers, friends of
his, who quarrelled and have not spoken for thirty years.&nbsp;
Yet they always live in the same camp, &ldquo;and when there is a
battle Kenza always comes and fights by Noah&rsquo;s side,
returning to his tent after the struggle without having said a
word.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their common cause is the concern of all: when
a gypsy is in trouble, money is always forthcoming for his
defence and to pay his fine.&nbsp; The chastity of <a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>the gypsy
women is the fact to which is owing the preservation of their
race purity against tremendous odds.</p>
<p>The occupations and customs of gypsies have not varied much
all the world over.&nbsp; The men have been jockeys and
horse-dealers and the women fortune-tellers.&nbsp; Borrow has
given more than one account of <i>hokano baro</i>, &ldquo;the
great trick,&rdquo; practised on credulous women, who hide money
or valuables in the earth or elsewhere, deluded by the Romany
chi&rsquo;s (gypsy woman&rsquo;s) promise that it shall magically
increase&mdash;and, of course, never find it again.&nbsp; The
three weeks generally prescribed as the term of its gestation are
quite long enough to put a sufficient number of miles between the
gypsy and her victim.&nbsp; The practice of <i>hokano baro</i> is
becoming rarer, probably not because of any reluctance on the
part of the gypsies to perform it, but because of the gradual
decline of the kind of superstition which made it possible.&nbsp;
There are relics of it in the West of England and
elsewhere.&nbsp; The village &ldquo;witch&rdquo; occasionally
makes an appearance in the police court, and not many years ago
in Cornwall a chi received imprisonment for a false pretence not
less ingenious than the <i>hokano baro</i>, and almost as
elaborate as some recent conspiracies in which no gypsies have
been involved.&nbsp; The bait in this case was money &ldquo;in
Chancery,&rdquo; and three Cornish housewives were effectually
swindled by a cleverly constructed story in which witchcraft, the
planets, <a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>phantom lawyers, and hidden property all played their
parts.</p>
<p>To hoax the gentile is a meritorious thing in a gypsy, and
there is evidence that the Romany people themselves are not as a
race superstitious.&nbsp; Their success depended in
Borrow&rsquo;s time upon cold calculation and rapid judgment of
the characters of the people with whom they had to deal.&nbsp;
Pepita&rsquo;s interview with Cristina in the palace, and the
trick of Aurora upon the wealthy widow lady <a
name="citation279"></a><a href="#footnote279"
class="citation">[279]</a> are evidence of that.&nbsp; Their
modern attitude is precisely the same, though I have been told of
one Welsh gypsy who believed she could work spells, had faith in
her own fortune-telling, and was believed in by other
gypsies.&nbsp; A well-known gryengro in the eastern counties, it
is said, never concludes any important horse-dealing transaction
till his mother has &ldquo;read the stars&rdquo; for him.&nbsp;
Some gypsies credit the seventh daughter with the power of true
divination.&nbsp; But in the main their art of dukkering,
bewitching, or fortune-telling, is merely the art of gauging the
personalities with which they are dealing, and, as Borrow says,
adapting their promises &ldquo;to the age and condition of the
parties who seek for information&rdquo;; the gypsy holds the hand
of her client, but her eyes are fixed upon the client&rsquo;s
face.&nbsp; Readers of <a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; a much more numerous company than
those who have studied &ldquo;The Zincali,&rdquo; will recall
references in those books to <i>draving balos</i>.&nbsp; This was
the pleasant custom of administering to pigs and other comestible
animals of the countryside a certain poison, which infallibly
deprived them of life but did not render their flesh unfit for
food.&nbsp; Having done this in secret, the gypsy would go up to
the farmer openly and offer some small price for the carcass, and
his offer would be accepted, since a porker supposed to have died
of disease was marketable in no other quarter.&nbsp; The custom
does not linger in England, but a recent traveller in Spain saw
at Martos, in the province of Jaen, a whole gypsy tribe feeding
on the roasted body of a poisoned pig.</p>
<p>Among the Romany habits quaintly discussed in &ldquo;The
Zincali&rdquo; <a name="citation280"></a><a href="#footnote280"
class="citation">[280]</a> which still survive in gypsydom is
that of the <i>patteran</i>, or trail&mdash;the bunches of twigs
or handfuls of grass scattered at a cross-road to indicate to
stragglers the way which their companions have taken.&nbsp; It
has been remarked that the ranks of the gryengroes, or
horse-dealers, of the class described in Borrow&rsquo;s books
have been greatly depleted, particularly by emigration to the
Western continent; but there are representatives of these, the
gypsy <a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>aristocracy, still to be seen at the English
horse-sales and fairs, and very formidable judges of a horse they
are, though I know of none quite so expert as Jasper
Petulengro.&nbsp; One of them not long ago bought a piece of land
near Lowestoft, in order that he and his friends might camp
undisturbed by the law and unvexed by the police.</p>
<p>No account of Borrow&rsquo;s gypsyism can neglect the
wonderful scene or series of scenes which, omitted from
&ldquo;The Zincali,&rdquo; were included in &ldquo;The Bible in
Spain,&rdquo; picturing his journey from Badajoz towards Madrid
in company with Antonio Lopez.&nbsp; These passages, in the ninth
and tenth chapters of the book, convey an extraordinary
impression of the gypsy character and of gypsy habits.&nbsp; They
contain sketches of persons and incidents vivid as lightning
flashes; they are full of Borrow&rsquo;s best matter and in his
most characteristic manner.&nbsp; See the fierce gitano in his
zamarra, or cloak of sheepskin, and his high-peaked Andalusian
hat, coming to interview the London Caloro (gypsy) who has so
strange a knowledge of their language that the gypsies for whom
he has written a gospel call him &ldquo;brother.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Antonio, bound on a journey on &ldquo;the affairs of
Egypt,&rdquo; has bethought him that the strange Caloro is going
to Madrid.&nbsp; The country is very disturbed; the gypsies are
taking advantage of the uproar to plunder the gentiles; and the
Caloro may fall a victim to them.&nbsp; Antonio proposes,
therefore, <a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>to accompany him as far as the frontiers of Castile, so
that he may not run the risk of a mistake; while, as for perils
from any other quarter than the bands of gypsy
brigands&mdash;does not Antonio carry in his bosom the magic
<i>bar lachi</i>, the lodestone, a talisman which renders him
immune from knife or bullet, and for him makes &ldquo;the dark
night the same as the fair day, and the wild carrascal [forest]
as the market-place?&rdquo;&nbsp; The <i>bar lachi</i> occupies a
prominent place in &ldquo;The Zincali,&rdquo; where a strange
story is told of the fascination exercised upon the
gitan&oacute;s by the large piece of lodestone in the museum at
Madrid, and the recipe is given for a magic potion consisting of
a little powder from the stone dropped in a glass of the potent
spirit aguardiente.&nbsp; Antonio had fortified himself with such
a draught before he came to make his proposal that they should
ride forth together, Borrow on the fleet horse which had cost
fifty dollars, and the gypsy on a mule.</p>
<p>From the moment when Borrow&rsquo;s love of adventure and
desire to get insight into Spanish gypsydom led him to accept
this strange proposal instead of going to Madrid in prosaic
British fashion by the stage-coach, his pages are lit by
variegated lights&mdash;the blaze of straw fires roasting pig,
the eye of the sun in dusty village streets, or its rays
percolating through the maze of forest trees, or the
brasero&rsquo;s glow in the vast ruined house in Merida, where
the gypsy crone tells him her story of torrid adventure <a
name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>in Morocco
among the Corahai, her fortune-telling and her hokkawaring
(deceiving) among the desert tribes.&nbsp; They are overhung by
the mystery of the object of Antonio&rsquo;s journey, which
remains unsolved.&nbsp; They echo with the weird converse of
Antonio himself, with his guitar-strings vibrating in the shadows
of the great room lit by an earthen lamp on the floor, with the
patter of the gypsy girls&rsquo; feet as they dance.&nbsp; Nobody
has ever mixed ingredients like these into such a dish as Borrow
served up&mdash;the ancient gitana who knew &ldquo;more crabbed
things and crabbed words than all the Errat&eacute; [gypsy folk]
betwixt here and Catalonia,&rdquo; the venal alguazils, or excise
officers, looking for contraband who were bribed by the present
of a cigar and frightened out of the house by the maledictions of
the old woman and her girls, the bivouac among the trees, the
dialogues on solemn questions with Pepindorio the pagan.</p>
<p>The most interesting gypsy-hunt in which Borrow indulged in
the later part of his life was the search in the Cheviot Hills
for relics of old Will Faa, the gypsy &ldquo;king,&rdquo;
smuggler, and innkeeper of Kirk Yetholm.&nbsp; Faa, the bearer of
a celebrated name in Scottish gypsydom, flourished in the
eighteenth century during those years when the nomads had
recovered from the effects of the early persecutions, and had not
yet been assailed by an organised rural police.&nbsp; This
monarch in the Augustan age of the Romanies had been a person of
great consequence in <a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>Borderland, and it was at the house
he occupied in Kirk Yetholm&mdash;an inn which in &rsquo;64 had
much of the appearance of a ruined Spanish posada&mdash;that
Borrow was gazing when a woman accosted him on gypsy subjects,
and told him that a granddaughter of Will Faa was residing in the
town.&nbsp; The incident, with his visit to this celebrity,
Esther Blyth, &ldquo;the Queen of the Nokkums,&rdquo; <a
name="citation284"></a><a href="#footnote284"
class="citation">[284]</a> provides the material for the last and
the best chapter of &ldquo;The Romano Lavo-Lil.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
describes his &ldquo;deep discourse&rdquo; with her &ldquo;about
matters Nokkum, about the words they used and the famous ones
among them in the older time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a curious forecast here of Leland&rsquo;s discovery
of Shelta, and its identification with the language of the
ancient Gaelic bards, though Borrow remained quite innocent of
its significance.&nbsp; The Queen of the Nokkums had not much
Romany, but used a &ldquo;poggado jib&rdquo; (a broken jargon)
consisting partly of gypsy words, partly of Lowland Scots, and
partly of cant, &ldquo;the allegorical jargon of
thieves.&rdquo;&nbsp; He remarks: &ldquo;Then she called a donkey
<i>asal</i>, and a stone <i>cloch</i>, which words are neither
cant nor gypsy, but Irish or Gaelic.&nbsp; I incurred her
vehement indignation by saying they were Gaelic.&nbsp; She
contradicted me flatly, and said that whatever I might
know&rdquo; (and he had been astonishing her with his Romany <a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>jib, as
usual), &ldquo;I was quite wrong there, for that neither she nor
any one of her people would condescend to speak anything so low
as Gaelic, or, indeed, if they possibly could avoid it, have
anything to do with the poverty-stricken creatures who used
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow goes on to moralise in his own way on the
effect built up in the minds of the public at large on the
subject of the Highlanders and their Gaelic by &ldquo;the magic
writings of Walter Scott,&rdquo; and to contrast it with the
contempt in which both people and language were held in
Scott&rsquo;s own land.</p>
<p>The faltering hand of age is all too plainly seen in this Kirk
Yetholm sketch.&nbsp; It has a certain interest, but it lacks the
wondrous witchery of his earlier dialogues with gypsies in
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Perhaps there was every bit as much of the picturesque and
romantic in his later intercourse with the swarthy people; but he
was not the same Borrow.&nbsp; He had not the old spirit, the
vim, the elasticity, and he could not invest his gypsy friends
and their surroundings with the charm that pervaded his former
writing on the subject.&nbsp; He had lost zest.&nbsp; He knew and
mentioned that the Romany chals and chis whom he saw in dingy
metropolitan suburbs or slums were out for a great part of the
year in the green lanes and pleasant ways of Kent; but he gives
us no pictures of the patch of grass, so vividly described by
Dickens about the same time, &ldquo;between the road-dust and the
trees,&rdquo; the place whose sweet <a name="page286"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>temptations &ldquo;all the tramps
with carts or caravans, the gypsy-tramp, the show-tramp, the
cheap-jack, find it impossible to resist,&rdquo; where &ldquo;all
turn the horse loose when they come to it, and boil the
pot.&nbsp; Bless the place!&nbsp; I love the ashes of the
vagabond fires that have scorched its grass!&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet
that was just the picture that would have appealed to the younger
Borrow.</p>
<p>During his residence in London he paid many visits to the
gypsy haunts in the neighbourhood, such as the
no-man&rsquo;s-land at Wandsworth, where was to be found a very
Babel of gypsies, mumpers, and Irish vagrants, as unlike a true
gypsy encampment as anything on earth&mdash;a medley of caravans
and carts, horses and donkeys, basket-makers and clothes-peg
carvers, broken-down pugilists and the scum of the nether
world.&nbsp; There were sketches to be made of such characters as
Mrs. Cooper, the deserted wife of Jack Cooper, a famous gypsy
prize-fighter.&nbsp; With her he would sit &ldquo;in her little
tent after she had taken her cup of tea . . . and hear her talk
of old times and things: how Jack courted her &rsquo;neath the
trees of Loughton Forest, and how, when tired of courting, they
would get up and box.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were suggestions to be
offered of such personalities as the &ldquo;dark, mysterious,
beautiful, terrible creature,&rdquo; with a lovely gypsy face,
but an expression &ldquo;evil&mdash;evil to a degree,&rdquo; who
was a puzzle to all the inhabitants of the gypsery, now dukkering
for servant girls or bandying slang with butcher-boys, and anon
&ldquo;in a beautiful half <a name="page287"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 287</span>riding-dress, her hair fantastically
plaited and adorned with pearls, standing beside the carriage of
a countess telling the fortune of her ladyship with the voice and
look of a pythoness.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were stories to be told
of the encampment at Latimer&rsquo;s Green in the north of
London, and of the rookery at &ldquo;The Mount,&rdquo; in the
East End, and there was a biography to be related of that
tremendous fellow, Ryley Bosvil, the tinker who wore gold pieces
for coat-buttons, who had two wives, gave himself grand airs, and
composed Romany verses, of which the following ode to one of his
better halves is a spirited specimen&mdash;the translation is
Borrow&rsquo;s:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Beneath the bright sun there is none, there
is none,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love like my Yocky Shuri;<br />
With the greatest delight in blood I would fight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the knees for my Yocky
Shuri!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in all these literary excursions into gypsydom, the
effervescence had gone.&nbsp; It was left for other pens to
transmute the gorgio&rsquo;s impressions of the Romany into real
poetry.&nbsp; And even Borrow&rsquo;s own adventures in these
later times are better described by another than by himself.</p>
<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton relates one of the best gypsy stories ever
told about Borrow.&nbsp; It arose out of a discussion between
them as to the probable nature of the appeal, if any, which
Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s poem of &ldquo;The Scholar Gypsy&rdquo;
would make to a real Romany chi.&nbsp; Borrow had ventured the
opinion that <a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>whatever might be the poetical merits of Arnold&rsquo;s
work, it was clear that he had no conception of the Romany
temper, and that gypsies would be unable either to understand its
motive or to sympathise with it.&nbsp; Mr. Watts-Dunton thought,
on the contrary, that, however blind a gypsy might be to the
beauties of Arnold&rsquo;s style, &ldquo;the motive was so
clearly developed that the most illiterate person could
understand it.&rdquo;&nbsp; They went off together to a gypsy
camp to test the question, agreeing to read the poem to the first
intelligent gypsy woman they should find&mdash;for gypsy men,
said Borrow, were &ldquo;too prosaic to furnish a fair
test.&rdquo;&nbsp; The encounter with the Romanies came about
through the discovery of a magpie crouching in a hawthorn
bush.&nbsp; The bird did not attempt to fly away as they
approached.&nbsp; Mr. Watts-Dunton exclaimed, &ldquo;It is
wounded, or else dying&mdash;or is it a tame bird escaped from a
cage?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hawk!&rdquo; said Borrow laconically, and
turned up his face and gazed into the sky.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
magpie is waiting till the hawk has caught his quarry and made
his meal.&nbsp; I fancy he has himself been
&lsquo;chivvied&rsquo; by the hawk, as the gypsies would
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there, sure enough, beneath one of the silver clouds that
specked the dazzling blue, a hawk&mdash;one of the kind which
takes its prey in the open rather than in the thick
woodlands&mdash;was wheeling up and up, and trying its best to
get above a poor little lark in order to stoop at and devour it.
. . .</p>
<p>As Borrow and his friend were gazing at the bird, a
woman&rsquo;s voice at their elbows said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky to chivvy the hawk that chivvies a
magpie.&nbsp; I shall stop here till the hawk&rsquo;s flew
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>They
turned round, and there stood a magnificent gypsy woman,
carrying, gypsy fashion, a weakly child that, in spite of its
sallow and wasted cheek, proclaimed itself to be hers.&nbsp; By
her side stood a young gipsy girl of about seventeen years of
age.&nbsp; She was beautiful&mdash;quite remarkably so&mdash;but
her beauty was not of the typical Romany kind.&nbsp; It was,
perhaps, more like the beauty of a Capri girl.</p>
<p>She was bareheaded&mdash;there was not even a gypsy
handkerchief on her head&mdash;her hair was not plaited, and was
not smooth and glossy like a gypsy girl&rsquo;s hair, but flowed
thick and heavy and rippling down the back of her neck and upon
her shoulders.&nbsp; In the tumbled tresses glittered certain
objects, which at first sight seemed to be jewels.&nbsp; They
were small dead dragon-flies of the crimson kind called
&ldquo;sylphs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The woman was a well-known gypsy, Perpinia Boswell, with whom
both students were acquainted.&nbsp; Borrow expressed surprise at
the condition of the infant, and remarked that the
&ldquo;chavo&rdquo; (baby) ought not to look like that with such
a mother.&nbsp; Perpinia agreed.&nbsp; It was a misery to her,
especially as her husband, Mike, was &ldquo;such a daddy,
too,&rdquo; stronger for a man than she was for a woman.&nbsp; A
great black cutty protruded between the woman&rsquo;s teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many pipes of tobacco do you smoke in a day?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Watts-Dunton.&nbsp; She could not say, but the girl
ventured the calculation that it was as many as she could afford
to buy.&nbsp; Her husband did not like her to smoke, and said it
made her look &ldquo;like an old Londra woman in Common Garding
Market.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You must not smoke another pipe,&rdquo;
said Borrow&rsquo;s friend to the mother&mdash;&ldquo;not another
pipe till the child leaves the breast.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Perpinia defiantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As if I could live without my pipe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy Pep a-livin&rsquo; without her baccy,&rdquo;
laughed the girl of the dragon-flies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your child can&rsquo;t live with it,&rdquo; said
Borrow&rsquo;s friend to Perpinia.&nbsp; &ldquo;That pipe of
yours is full of a poison called nicotine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick what?&rdquo; said the girl, laughing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a new kind o&rsquo; Nick.&nbsp; Why, you
smoke yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicotine,&rdquo; said Borrow&rsquo;s friend; &ldquo;and
the first part of Pep&rsquo;s body that the poison gets into is
her breast, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gets into my burk?&rdquo; said Perpinia; &ldquo;get
along wi&rsquo; ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it poison Pep&rsquo;s milk?&rdquo; said the
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t true,&rdquo; said Perpinia;
&ldquo;can&rsquo;t be true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> true,&rdquo; said Borrow&rsquo;s
friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t give up that pipe for a
time the child will die, or else be a rickety thing all his
life.&nbsp; If you <i>do</i> give it up, it will grow up to be as
fine a Romany chal as Mike himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chavo agin pipe, Pep,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lend me your pipe, Perpinia,&rdquo; said Borrow, in
that hail-fellow-well-met tone of his which he reserved for the
Romanies&mdash;a tone which no Romany could ever resist.&nbsp;
And he took it gently from the woman&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t smoke any more till I come to the camp and see
the chavo again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman looked very angry at first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He be&rsquo;s a good-friend to the Romanies,&rdquo;
said the girl in an appeasing tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;but
he&rsquo;s no business to take my pipe out o&rsquo; my mouth for
all that.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She made no further protest, but remained to keep guard over
the magpie which was to bring luck to her chavo, while Borrow
walked away with the pipe in his pocket, accompanied by his
friend and the young girl.&nbsp; The three sat down on a fallen
tree to put Arnold&rsquo;s poem through the crucible of the <a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>gypsy
mind.&nbsp; The girl was a beauty of the most entrancing type to
be found among her race, and her loveliness made a strong appeal
even to Borrow, whose taste&mdash;the subject of frequent
remark&mdash;was not so much for tawny women, however seductive,
as for tall and stately fair girls, such as Isopel Berners and
the queens of the North.&nbsp; The gypsy&rsquo;s complexion, says
Mr. Watts-Dunton,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;though darker than an English girl&rsquo;s,
was rather lighter than any ordinary gypsy&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Her
eyes were of an indescribable hue, but an artist who has since
then painted her portrait for Borrow&rsquo;s friend described it
as a mingling of pansy-purple and dark tawny.&nbsp; The pupils
were so large that, being set in the somewhat almond-shaped and
long-eyelashed lids of her race, they were partly curtained both
above and below, and this had the effect of making the eyes seem
always a little contracted and just about to smile.&nbsp; The
great size and deep richness of the eyes made the straight little
nose seem smaller than it really was, they also lessened the
apparent size of the mouth, which, red as a rosebud, looked quite
small until she laughed, when the white teeth made quite a wide
glitter.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poem was interrupted, before three lines had been read, by
a swarm of dragon-flies which swam in the sunshine around the
girl&rsquo;s head, causing her to exclaim that the
&ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s needles&rdquo; were come to sew up her eyes
for killing their brothers.&nbsp; &ldquo;I dussn&rsquo;t set
here,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Us Romanies call this
&lsquo;Dragon-fly brook.&rsquo;&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s the king
of the dragon-flies; he lives here.&rdquo;&nbsp; The insects
presently disappeared, and she sat down again to hear the lil
(book).&nbsp; She was interested in the prose story of Glanville,
on which Arnold&rsquo;s poem was founded, but <a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>the poem
itself bewildered her, except that &ldquo;her eyes flashed now
and then at the lovely bits of description.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
read a second time.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t make out what the
lil&rsquo;s all about&mdash;seems all about nothink!&nbsp; Seems
to me that the pretty sights what makes a Romany fit to jump out
o&rsquo; her skin for joy makes this &rsquo;ere gorgio want to
cry.&nbsp; What a rum lot gorgios is sure<i>ly</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>And then she sprang up and ran off towards the
camp with the agility of a greyhound, turning round every few
moments, pirouetting and laughing aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beauty of that girl,&rdquo; Borrow again murmured,
&ldquo;is quite&mdash;quite&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he did not finish his sentence, but after a while
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was all true about the nicotine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partly, I think,&rdquo; said his friend, &ldquo;but not
being a medical man I must not be too emphatic.&nbsp; If it
<i>is</i> true it ought to be a criminal offence for any woman to
smoke in excess while she is suckling a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it ought to be a criminal offence for a woman to
smoke at all,&rdquo; growled Borrow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fancy kissing a
woman&rsquo;s mouth that smelt of stale
tobacco&mdash;pheugh!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow did not forget the incident.&nbsp; Perpinia abstained
from tobacco, and in a fortnight, after several visits to the
camp, he had the satisfaction of knowing that the child was
recovering from its illness.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Is not Perpinia very grateful to you and to
me?&rdquo; said the friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Borrow, with a twinkle in his
eye.&nbsp; &ldquo;She manages to feel grateful to you and me for
making her give up the pipe, and also to believe at the same time
that her child was saved by the good luck that came to her
because she guarded the magpie.&rdquo;</p>

293</span>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BORROW&rsquo;S BOOKS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> was the appeal made to a
very wide public by &ldquo;The Bible in Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; What
was the nature of the appeal?&nbsp; It was unique; but it was not
inherently surprising.&nbsp; &ldquo;I woke one morning and found
myself famous,&rdquo; said Byron of the reception of
&ldquo;Childe Harold.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s gigantic leap
from the shades of chilly neglect into the sunshine of popularity
was equally sudden and less obviously explicable.&nbsp; He had
none of the social advantages that helped to spread the notoriety
of Byron&rsquo;s achievement.&nbsp; Comparatively few people knew
anything about the obscure son of the adjutant of the Norfolk
Militia; and we have already seen that his special type of genius
made no special impression on that generation.&nbsp; Yet
&ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; went forth from Albemarle Street
into &ldquo;the reading world&rdquo; to make a triumphal progress
amidst storms of applause.</p>
<p>This furore was created not entirely by the real merits of the
book, but largely by adventitious circumstances.&nbsp; It has
great merits.&nbsp; But there is more work, there is better work,
in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;; the latter is a far more
representative Borrow book <a name="page294"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 294</span>than its forerunner.&nbsp; It has
more of Borrow&rsquo;s humour, more of his subtility; it is far
more fascinating as a human document.&nbsp; Yet
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; was still-born.&nbsp; It was received with
no applause.&nbsp; The critics disapproved of it, and the public
did not buy it.&nbsp; Whereas thirty-five thousand copies of
&ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; were sold in a year, it took the
same time to get rid of a thousand copies of
&ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, the real reasons of the
success of 1843 did not reside primarily in the qualities for
which we admire the book to-day.&nbsp; The attributes that make
it something more than a mere record of a colporteur&rsquo;s
labours, its picaresque liveliness, its saturnine humour, its
vivid sketches of romantic rascality, keep it alive.&nbsp; The
narrator moves, like some new Gil Blas, through a series of
scenes which give the reader a savour of the atmosphere of Spain
hardly excelled in English literature.&nbsp; It is evident from
the experience of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; that these were not the
attributes that caused the book to sell in its thousands when it
was published.&nbsp; The cause of its huge circulation was that
it appealed to a public which would buy in large quantities a
record of missionary enterprise and religious adventure, and
would not have bought any book that Borrow could write if the
religious interest had been absent.&nbsp; No doubt, when they had
bought and read, the quality of the work as literature produced
in them unaccustomed and pleasing sensations not to be obtained
from most books purchased for <a name="page295"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 295</span>similar reasons.&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s evangelism attracted them and his art retained
them.</p>
<p>The bulk of &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; consists of
transcripts of letters written to the Bible Society reporting
upon his proceedings in the Peninsula.&nbsp; Suppose the letters
had never been written.&nbsp; Suppose Borrow had merely described
his travels and adventures in Spain in a secular-fashion, is it
possible to question that the book would have shared the same
fate, as &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;?&nbsp; Partly by design, partly
by accident, the contents were skilfully mixed and flavoured to a
nicety.&nbsp; True, it contained more than a
<i>soup&ccedil;on</i> of gypsyism and scoundrelism.&nbsp; True,
its finest passages are devoted to gypsies and vagabonds and
their haunts and habits.&nbsp; Yet, the dominant elements are
religious.&nbsp; It is not proposed to suggest that any hypocrisy
is involved.&nbsp; Borrow was, in his peculiar fashion, a deeply
religious man.&nbsp; His passionate Protestantism was thoroughly
sincere.&nbsp; When he declaimed against Romish superstitions,
and laid his vigorous flail upon Batuscha, &ldquo;the
paralytic,&rdquo; he meant every word he said.&nbsp; When,
describing the ravishing scenery at Monte Moro, he declares,
&ldquo;I sat down on a broken wall and remained gazing, and
listening, and shedding tears of rapture; for of all the
pleasures which a bountiful God permitteth His children to enjoy,
none are so dear to some hearts as the music of forests and
streams . . . &rdquo; he is not canting for the benefit of Earl
Street, though in <a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>other circumstances the sentiment might have been
differently expressed.&nbsp; And the majority of his readers
perused this with the Bible Society in their minds.&nbsp; One
remembers having &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; placed in
one&rsquo;s youthful hands, with stress laid on the fact that
this was the work of a man who had encountered infinite perils
and suffered amazing hardships in a pious cause, and with
injunctions to observe not the remarkable beauties of the book
but the benighted condition of the priest-ridden children of
Spain, to compare it with the blessings of unlimited
Bible-reading which oneself enjoyed.</p>
<p>There is no need to labour this point.&nbsp; The perspective
has cleared with the passage of years.&nbsp; There is no less
admiration for the fine work which the Bible Society did and is
doing, and a great deal more perspicuous admiration of
Borrow&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; Literature owes much to the Bible
Society in many ways, and one of its debts lies here&mdash;that
it found Borrow employment at a time when he was in sore straits,
and provided him with the means of introducing to the public the
fruits of his literary labour.</p>
<p>It has already been suggested that, in point of art,
&ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; does not bear comparison with
&ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; For what it is worth, that is a
deliberate judgment.&nbsp; But it should be said that no such
comparison ought to be instituted.&nbsp; The two books are widely
different in inspiration, in purpose, in execution.&nbsp; The
record of the Spanish journeys <a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>has an interest of its own, and may
stand on its own merits.&nbsp; As a descriptive and narrative
writer Borrow had few superiors in his time.&nbsp; His style
smacks of Defoe, smacks of the Bible, smacks of the archaic poets
and romancers he loved so well.&nbsp; But it is his own
style&mdash;at once a noble and spacious style and no style at
all.&nbsp; There is no preciosity and there is little elegance in
it; but there is naturalism, virility, grandeur.&nbsp; Only when
he becomes didactic does his power decline.&nbsp; Then, in spite
of his tremendous vigour of invective, he rarely rises above the
level of the leader-writer, with his eye on the thing nearest to
his fond prejudices, searching for the most offensive word that
happens to be handy.</p>
<p>There is probably less sermonising in &ldquo;The Bible in
Spain&rdquo; than in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany
Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow is in love with Spain as Spain.&nbsp; He
abounds in admiration of the country and its climate, the
nobility of its people and their &ldquo;stern, heroic
virtue.&rdquo;&nbsp; He does not gloss over the savagery and
crime to be found among them, but he observes that there is very
little of low, vulgar vice in the great body of the Spanish
nation.&nbsp; His fulminations are reserved for the politicians
and the warring factions that distressed the land, and for the
&ldquo;atrocious projects of malignant Rome.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is
generous in his approval of the valour and the probity of the
people as a whole.&nbsp; He moves among them with a freedom that
can only be attained by the man who knows the <a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>language&mdash;and not by all men who know it.&nbsp;
For Spaniards are sensitive about their noble tongue, and do not
like to hear it mutilated by those who are not to the manner
born.&nbsp; Borrow had no nervousness about his linguistic
powers.&nbsp; He gives some entertaining instructions to
Englishmen who want to make themselves understood in a foreign
language: they should speak with much noise and vociferation,
opening their mouths wide.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it surprising,&rdquo;
he asks, &ldquo;that the English are in general the worst
linguists in the world, seeing that they pursue a system
diametrically opposite?&nbsp; For example, when they attempt to
speak Spanish, the most sonorous tongue in existence, they
scarcely open their lips, and, putting their hands in their
pockets, fumble lazily instead of applying them to the
indispensable office of gesticulation.&rdquo;&nbsp; He, at any,
rate, succeeded in vociferating and gesticulating his way through
Spain to good purpose, and his picture of the country is enriched
by a wealth of intimacy that would have been beyond the power of
almost any other Englishman.</p>
<p>It is astonishing that a man with so many insular prejudices
as Borrow, a person so dogmatic, and so utterly scornful of the
religion that pervades the very soil of Spain, should have been
able to ingratiate himself with its people as he did, while on an
errand which most of them must have considered damnably
heretical.&nbsp; The secret is to be sought in his love of the
romantic and the quality of <i>simpatia</i>, which, in <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>spite of
all his idiosyncrasies, he possessed in very high degree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; is a piece of Borrow.&nbsp;
That provides its principal charm.&nbsp; It is not peppered with
&ldquo;dots and asterisks&rdquo; in the same way as
&ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; and does not depend for any great part of
its effect on ellipsis.&nbsp; But it is still delightfully
irresponsible and inconsequential, full of quaint snatches of
character, of rough sketches of picturesque figures, of bits of
adventure which lead nowhere, yet carry the reader on from
incident to incident with a fascination as irresistible as the
elusive attractions of Tristram Shandy.&nbsp; There are solid
values as well.&nbsp; There are the rugged, unpremeditated
eloquence of its descriptions, the vivid colouring of its persons
in the piece, and, the never-flagging gallop of its action.&nbsp;
One would be hard pressed to name a book of its kind in which
stir and progression are more constant.</p>
<p>On every page peep realistic portraits at which the reader has
just time to glance before he is hurried on.&nbsp; Who can ever
forget the goatherd on the mountain between Monte Moro and Elvas,
who recalled to Borrow&rsquo;s mind Brute Carle in the ballad of
Swayne Vonved?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A wild swine on his shoulders he kept,<br
/>
And upon his bosom a black bear slept;<br />
And about his fingers, with hair o&rsquo;erhung,<br />
The squirrel sported and weasel clung,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that weird figure of a man, with the otter slung around his
neck, who could not read, but, when he <a
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>was asked
whether he knew aught of God or Christ, &ldquo;turned his
countenance towards the sun, which was beginning to sink in the
west, nodded to it, and then again looked fixedly upon me.&nbsp;
I believe that I understood the mute reply, which probably was
that it was God who made that glorious light which illumes and
gladdens all creation; and gratified with that belief I left him.
. . .&rdquo;&nbsp; Who does not treasure the cameo of the drunken
driver of Evora, who, having wrecked his carriage and killed his
mule, exclaimed, &ldquo;Paciencia! . . . It was God&rsquo;s will
that she should die.&nbsp; What more can be said?&rdquo;&nbsp; Or
the portrait of the Manchegan prophetess that aroused the wrath
of Mr. Brandram; or of the pig-merchant who sang the
&ldquo;Marseillaise&rdquo; and brandished his snick-and-snee in
the inn at Badajoz?&nbsp; Or, in a different medium, the picture
of Mendizabal, the Jewish Prime Minister, who told Borrow it was
not Bibles they wanted in Spain, but guns and gunpowder with
which to put down the rebels?&nbsp; Or, on a different scale, the
visions of the Jews of Lisbon and the &ldquo;children of
Egypt&rdquo; who tried to tempt him to a horse deal at
Duenas?</p>
<p>Borrow was in Spain during some of the most exciting years of
its modern history.&nbsp; He tells us that he had no politics
except those of the gypsies&mdash;promising success to both
sides, and ultimately joining the one which won.&nbsp; That was
perhaps a very proper attitude for a foreigner and a person who
had <a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>to
rely on official favour in order to get his work of Bible
distribution done.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this, he does not
conceal his contempt for the Carlist cause.&nbsp; His posadero at
Cordova was &ldquo;an egregious Carlist,&rdquo; and though he
expressly told his friend, the correspondent of the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i> in Madrid, that he was not a Liberal, his
sympathies certainly lay away from the ultramontism of the
insurgents.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s Spanish politics, of course, are
of little importance; his sketches of political events, on the
other hand, are not only interesting but valuable.&nbsp; His
record of the circumstances which led up to the death of General
Quesada is the account of an eye-witness, and is adopted by Major
Martin Hume in his &ldquo;Story of Spain,&rdquo; though doubt is
thrown upon the sensational tale of the Revolution of La Granja,
where the Queen is made to succumb to the desires of the
Constitutionalists by the threat of shooting her paramour,
Mu&ntilde;oz, before her eyes.&nbsp; One of the most
characteristic bits of Borrow&rsquo;s work is his portrait of
Baltasar, the &ldquo;National,&rdquo; and one of his
unsurpassable touches of description is given to the celebration,
in the Caf&eacute; of the Calle d&rsquo;Alcala, of
Quesada&rsquo;s assassination, the huge bowl of coffee mixed for
the blood-drunken soldiery, and <i>el panuelo</i>, the blue
kerchief whose ghastly contents were used to stir the
mixture.&nbsp; Those contents were the severed hand and fingers
of Quesada, the mutilated bones celebrated in the refrain which
resounded through the hall:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
302</span>&ldquo;Que es lo que abaja<br />
Por aquel cerro?<br />
Ta ra ra ra ra!<br />
Son los huesos de Quesada,<br />
Que los trae un perro. . . .&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Baltasar&rsquo;s invitation to &ldquo;Don Jorge&rdquo; to
drink of the cup on this &ldquo;pleasant day for Spain&rdquo;
relieves with a touch of humour a scene which would otherwise be
as revolting as the archaic ceremony of the vulpinised wine after
a fox-hunt.&nbsp; The variety and rapid movement of the scene are
remarkable, but not more so than those of fifty other scenes in
the book; and the waggish little assassin Baltasar is no quainter
than fifty other characters, from Borrow&rsquo;s own Greek
servant, Antonio, to Judah Lib, the Jew of Galatia, or Benedict
Moll, the Swiss.</p>
<p>It is the essence of Spain that Borrow gives us in his
inimitable, erratic way, its hot love and burning hate, its high
chivalry and its profound roguery, the ineffable beauty of its
women and the ugly rags of its mendicants, the solemn dignity of
its people and their saline wit, contrasted with his own
sententiousness and his peculiar, mordant humour.&nbsp; The
vitality of the book, the continuing effect of its best scenes,
and the never-failing interest of its adventures, are
wonderful.</p>
<p>Yet there is hardly a Borrovian who does not prefer
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo;
regarding them as one book, to anything else that Borrow ever
did.&nbsp; It is incomparably the finest and <a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>most
fragrant efflorescence of his genius.&nbsp; The fascination
exercised by &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; over a considerable part of
the human race is difficult to explain: its secret is as elusive
as a great deal else in Borrow.&nbsp; But its existence cannot be
questioned.&nbsp; It has hypnotised men of vastly different
temperaments, causing this one to devote his life to the
delightful, if unprofitable, pursuit of the mysteries concealed
behind Borrow&rsquo;s &ldquo;dots and asterisks&rdquo; and the
filling up of his ellipses, and that one to become a student of
Romany and a &ldquo;gypsiologist&rdquo; who would otherwise have
remained indifferent to the history and character of the chals
and chis.</p>
<p>Many discussions have been held upon the nature of this
secret.&nbsp; It still avoids capture; it cannot be precipitated
into words.&nbsp; Some explanation of its effects may be offered,
but even that can be but tentative.&nbsp; The book appeals to
primal instincts.&nbsp; It quivers with life.&nbsp; It stirs the
deepest emotions of those who have the sub-conscious love of
Nature&mdash;the instinct for Nature which manifests itself not
in petty eulogies of the fine things of the world, but in silent,
ecstatic content with Earth.&nbsp; Gypsies have it strongly
developed; indeed, it explains gypsyism.&nbsp; The book abounds
in the unconventional strong man, in his joy of conflict, in his
curiosity about human villainy, and his admiration of all heroic
qualities.&nbsp; It is in the succession of Defoe, and in a less
degree of Fielding, and again in a less degree of Smollett, and
<a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>it
awakes nearly all the sensations produced by them in turn, with
the saving grace we have noted&mdash;that it is never in the
least salacious or even obscene.</p>
<p>Another favourite theme of debate has been the
autobiographical problem.&nbsp; We have traced the history of the
composition of &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; and seen that the book is
truly an autobiography, though not a chronology.&nbsp; Borrow
invented little and recorded much.&nbsp; Most of the things that
happen in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; happened in its author&rsquo;s
life, as Elwin said.&nbsp; He unquestionably grouped figures and
events for the sake of effect.&nbsp; Such a concatenation as
Borrow himself, Isopel Berners, the Petulengros, Tawno Chikno,
the Man in Black, and the Innkeeper in the immediate
neighbourhood of one Staffordshire dingle at the same time was,
of course, never known to history.&nbsp; Such dramatis
person&aelig; are far too striking to have been collected by
coincidence.&nbsp; The meeting of the queenly Isopel, princess of
roadside heroines, and Lavengro, crallis (chief) of hedge
philologists, and their method of intellectual commerce, tax the
credulity of the reader sufficiently.&nbsp; But the residuum of
fact is considerable; there is more essential truth than concrete
fiction in &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; and it complies with the terms
of Borrow&rsquo;s own conception of an autobiography.</p>
<p>It has been shown that the world was unready for such a
book.&nbsp; It was busy about diverse affairs.&nbsp; It had
passed out of the Byronic phase in which <a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>Borrow
attempted to detain it.&nbsp; The men of 1850 were unable to
appreciate his manner, and cared nothing about his matter.&nbsp;
Now that he made no definite appeal to the Bible Society public,
and had removed himself out of the atmosphere of Old Spain,
shimmering with romance, he found that there was no public left
for him.&nbsp; What use had the world in the climacterical year
of the great, progressive nineteenth century for the petty
philosophy and the infinitesimal adventures of a tinker who was
not &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; in any sense of which it was
cognisant?&nbsp; It was just about to appoint Matthew Arnold as
Inspector of Schools: that was more to the purpose.&nbsp; It had
crowned Alfred Tennyson as Poet Laureate; it was weeping and
roaring over &ldquo;David Copperfield&rdquo;; it was preparing to
admit Thackeray among the Immortals, for he was on the point of
publishing &ldquo;The History of Henry Esmond, Esq.&rdquo;&nbsp;
If it wanted fierce controversy, was not Carlyle thundering out
his &ldquo;Latter-day Pamphlets&rdquo;?&nbsp; If it wanted
picturesque history, was not Macaulay sufficient&mdash;were not
working men&rsquo;s clubs in Lancashire passing him votes of
thanks for having made history intelligible to the masses?&nbsp;
If it wanted politics or economics, did it not possess its John
Bright and its Richard Cobden, and was there not Mill&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Principles of Political Economy,&rdquo; fresh from the
press, to be read?&nbsp; It wanted Free Libraries, not free
manners.&nbsp; Ruskin could satisfy all its taste for
archaism.&nbsp; It had rid <a name="page306"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 306</span>itself of Chartism, and was
coquetting with Christian Socialism; &ldquo;Alton Locke&rdquo;
was far more likely to appeal to its sympathies than the
innkeeper at Willenhall.</p>
<p>One perceives how inevitable was the dismal fate of
&ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; launched at the head of a society
fermenting, effervescing, seething with progressive optimism,
feverish in its eager industrial advance, filled with sentiment,
vibrating with hopeful emotions, its literary affections fastened
partly upon Macaulay, partly upon Carlyle, partly upon
Tennyson.&nbsp; The apparition of a book like
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; was ludicrous in its eyes, dressed in the
style of a dead century, and concerned with subjects as dead as
its habiliments.&nbsp; What had all this farrago of gypsies,
horse-witches, apple-women, green lanes, breezy heaths, and
road-girls (however magnificent) to do with any soul in 1850,
with Manchesterism or with Kingsleyism, with the buzz of
commercial prosperity, or the growth of social idealism or the
development of political liberties, or with current culture, or
with the sentiment of the age?&nbsp; Nothing at all.&nbsp; The
frantically busy world went on building schools and inspecting
them, planning railways and running trains on them, raising mills
and factories and grinding and making, discussing problems and
settling them; and it passed Borrow by.&nbsp; It did not want a
Romany Defoe, a modern Smollett, a new and more truculent Bunyan,
and it barely nodded to him as he attempted to arrest <a
name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>its
steps.&nbsp; It cared not a brass farthing about his opinions,
which did not matter at all; unfortunately, it cared as little
about his naturalism, which mattered a great deal.</p>
<p>The only point of approach between Borrow and the public was
the point of anti-Popery.&nbsp; Borrow anticipated the storm of
1850, for the bulk of his work had been written before that storm
broke.&nbsp; His Man in Black was modelled upon what he knew of
the Catholic propagandists in England, but the model was highly
coloured; it was impossible for Borrow to view a priest or a
Catholic of any degree except through the medium of his own
ultra-Protestant spectacles.&nbsp; Further, the portrait is
probably more malicious than it would have been but for the state
of public opinion on the &ldquo;Papal aggression&rdquo; which was
then being foreshadowed.&nbsp; The Man in Black is a very
complete picture of the Jesuitical sneak who probably existed
only in the imagination of ardent Evangelicals.&nbsp; But even
this accidentally topical character did not save from disaster a
work which was utterly out of tune with the times.&nbsp; Imagine
Macaulay, or Kingsley, or Ruskin falling on their readers in the
manner of Borrow&rsquo;s preface:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Pray, be not displeased, gentle reader, if
perchance thou hast imagined that I was about to conduct thee to
distant lands, and hadst promised thyself much instruction and
entertainment from what I might tell thee of them.&nbsp; I do
assure thee that thou hast no reason to be displeased, inasmuch
as there are no countries in the world less known by the British
<a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>than
these selfsame British islands, or where more strange things are
everyday occurring, whether in road or street, house or
dingle.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was all very true, but the &ldquo;gentle reader&rdquo; did
not want to hear about those strange things, and his ear found
Borrow&rsquo;s &ldquo;thees&rdquo; and &ldquo;thous&rdquo; and
&ldquo;hadsts&rdquo; uncouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Charity and free and
genial manners&rdquo; in the Borrovian sense were foreign to his
desires.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s own favourite characters in
&ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; he tells us, were the brave old soldier
and his wife (his parents), the ancient gentlewoman who sold
apples on London Bridge and conned the history of blessed Mary
Flanders, and the wandering Methodist and his wife
Winifred.&nbsp; Filial affection accounts for his first
choice.&nbsp; The others are certainly delightful vignettes; but
it is strange that Borrow did not bring Jasper Petulengro into
his category of favourites, or Isopel Berners.&nbsp; Those two
are immortal, and it is to them that the mind flies when
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; is mentioned.</p>
<p>The book&mdash;still regarding &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; as
part of it&mdash;divides itself into two sections.&nbsp; The
first and shorter section covers a period of some twenty years;
the other, his idyll of the roads, extending from the
fifty-eighth chapter of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; to the end, deals
with about a year of his life.&nbsp; The subject of his rural
wanderings grew upon him as he wrote, and the episode of Belle
Berners naturally required a spacious canvas; the reasons why he
introduced <a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>the postilion&rsquo;s tale have already been
related.&nbsp; This amazing book defies analysis or
classification.&nbsp; It is &ldquo;a thing of shreds and
patches,&rdquo; a hotch-potch of odds and ends of learning and
speculation, an uneven jumble of incidents; doubtless it is all
the critics of 1851 said it was.&nbsp; Yet it is a great book, a
treasured book, a book to read five times as Leland read it, to
dip into and be tempted on and on, chapter by chapter.&nbsp; It
has all the faults that the purists allot to it&mdash;much
tiresome iteration, many split infinitives, gross errors of
taste, much fuliginous and turgid writing.&nbsp; Yet it is a
great work of literature, compelling, overpowering in many
ways.&nbsp; It often rises in eloquence to remarkable heights and
glows with all the hues of poetry: mark the dialogue on death,
the midnight vigil in the Dingle.&nbsp; The force of sheer
description in the poison scene and in the fight with the Flaming
Tinman can hardly be surpassed.&nbsp; There are racy humour and
genuine humanity in the incident of the inn where he met Jack
Slingsby and his family depressed from the encounter with the
Flaming Tinman, and proved to them the &ldquo;genial, gladdening
power&rdquo; of good ale, &ldquo;the true and proper drink of
Englishmen.&rdquo;&nbsp; All Borrow&rsquo;s affectation of
learning, all his word-chasing, all his preaching, are forgiven
in the intense joy of such scenes as these.&nbsp; When Jack
Slingsby said to him, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine thing to be a
scholar,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;Not half so fine as to be a
tinker.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is the hedgesmith in Lavengro that gives
<a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>his book
its ineffable charm.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is something highly
poetical about a forge,&rdquo; and Borrow has caught and
transmitted its poetry to us.</p>
<p>The fashion in which Borrow pounced upon his critics,
detractors, enemies, as he pictured them, clawed them and mangled
them in the notorious Appendix has been indicated in
snatches.&nbsp; Printed sermons and speeches can hardly be more
deadly dull than a quarrel of this sort after the lapse of half a
century: that is, as a rule.&nbsp; In this case there is a
distinct survival of literary interest, for the Appendix is
luminous (albeit with a lurid incandescence), and in it glow some
of the gems of Borrow&rsquo;s style.&nbsp; His critics inspired
him to this <i>tour de force</i>, the &ldquo;quartering
reviewers,&rdquo; those arbitrary persons who, in the sententious
phrase of Hazlitt, &ldquo;would be thought to have purchased a
monopoly of wit, learning, and wisdom&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Assume the rod, affect the god,<br />
And seem to shake the spheres.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we have seen, they cauterised Borrow because he had not
written the book they expected him to write, just as their
predecessors had &ldquo;pulled Pope to pieces&rdquo; for not
being Shakespeare or Milton.&nbsp; Borrow was odd and singular,
and had transgressed every canon of the taste of the time.&nbsp;
But he was fully conscious that he had written a fine book.&nbsp;
Their abuse, their satire, their indifference sent him into a
fine frenzy, in which he pretended to despise the whole
tribe.&nbsp; <a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
311</span>&ldquo;By God! &rsquo;tis good, and if you lik&rsquo;t
you may.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the affectation was ill-sustained by
the performance; he set about to bludgeon them in very good
earnest, and seized the opportunity of time, space, and
inclination to wield his weapon across the heads of a great many
other offenders besides the critics.</p>
<p>The bludgeon is the only possible figure to use.&nbsp; In this
amazing display of whirling invective Borrow is like no other
protagonist in literature.&nbsp; For many reasons it were
possible to wish that he had never written it; for others it is
precious.&nbsp; It neither pricks the enemy like Pope, nor
incises him like Swift, nor burns him like Gifford, nor lashes
him like Byron.&nbsp; It simply pounds him as the Flaming Tinman
was pounded by Borrow&rsquo;s long right.&nbsp; It begins,
innocently enough, with an exposition of the principles on which
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; was written, the principles it upheld, the
morals it inculcated, and the author&rsquo;s reasons for
supposing that it deserved well of the world.&nbsp; In this last
particular the chapter is curious.&nbsp; According to Borrow, the
book is worthy because it demonstrates how the hand of Providence
constantly guides the destinies of the hero, preventing him in
all his doings from falling a prey either to vice or to
poverty.&nbsp; He admitted that Lavengro was not a remarkably
religious person up to the point where the book took leave of
him, but it was very likely that he would eventually become
religious, though not precise or straight-laced.&nbsp; He would
retain with his <a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
312</span>scholarship &ldquo;something of his gypsyism, his
predilection for the hammer and tongs, and perhaps some
inclination to put on certain gloves&mdash;not white
kid&mdash;with any friend who might be inclined for a little
old-English diversion.&rdquo;&nbsp; The absence of any
straight-lacedness from his character was also to be predicated
in the matter of ale.&nbsp; He did not believe that either
fondness for invigorating exercise or willingness to partake of
any of the good things provided by the Almighty (meaning
especially ale with plenty of malt, not too much hops, and at
least two years old) would be any bar to his entrance into
heaven.</p>
<p>One would not for worlds suggest that Borrow laid this stress
upon the moralities and the theology of his book what time his
tongue was in his cheek.&nbsp; But he could hardly have failed to
see that it was his gypsyism rather than his theology that would
lend the work its permanent importance.&nbsp; The second chapter
of the Appendix is an anti-Popery tirade which it would be
tiresome to follow.&nbsp; He boasts of how in Spain he
&ldquo;hewed right and left, making the priests fly before him
and run away squeaking that the Devil was after
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which is hardly an accurate account of the
matter, and is only introduced apparently in order that he may
belabour Bowring.&nbsp; The process is this: The Bible Society
sent Borrow to Spain to perform these deeds of derringdo; the
Bible Society was not supported by the Government, but rather
frowned upon, so that any man wearing <a name="page313"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 313</span>its colours was excluded from the
chance of serving his country, while &ldquo;a fellow who unites
in himself the bankrupt trader, the broken author, or rather
book-maker, and the laughed-down single-speech spouter of the
House of Commons, may look forward, always supposing that he has
been a foaming Radical, to the Government of an important
colony.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems almost necessary to apologise, even
at this distance of time, to the descendants of Sir John Bowring,
so virulent and unjust is Borrow in his strictures.</p>
<p>Borrow is accused of bigotry in his anti-Papist
campaign.&nbsp; Bigotry!&nbsp; There is no excuse for even a
whisper of the word in anything that he has done.&nbsp; Bigots
yourselves, messieurs!&nbsp; A person may speak and write against
Rome without bigotry, but &ldquo;it is impossible for anyone but
a bigot or a bad man to write or speak in her
praise.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which clears the ground for an understanding
of the outlook of our very paragon of all tolerance.</p>
<p>In the third chapter, &ldquo;On Foreign Nonsense,&rdquo; there
speaks John Bull, the patriotic Briton, the Germanophobe in a
time when Teutophilism was the fashion, who, in the heyday of the
prophet Carlyle&rsquo;s authority, declared that &ldquo;of German
literature&rdquo;&mdash;but words failed him to characterise
German literature, and he had to express himself by a note of
exclamation and a dash, and grudgingly admitted that there was
<i>one</i> fine poem in the German
language&mdash;&ldquo;Oberon,&rdquo; to wit.&nbsp; This from the
disciple of <a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>William Taylor was a little strong; but Borrow on the
rampage trampled even on Taylor, with a reservation of praise for
his scholarship.&nbsp; The essay on
&ldquo;gentility-nonsense&rdquo; is decidedly the best of them
all.&nbsp; These two chapters are the most effective, the richest
in the diction of wrath, and they touch the highest point he
reaches in criticism.&nbsp; Here, if anywhere, is to be found the
merit of the Appendix.</p>
<p>It is this revolt against the finnicking conventions, this
hard-hitting at every self-sufficient snob&rsquo;s head in a
self-satisfied age, that gives the work its air of modernity, and
places it <i>en rapport</i> with the twentieth century.&nbsp;
Once again there is no delicate satire, no fine irony, no touch
of the &ldquo;Snob Papers,&rdquo; in the
&ldquo;gentility-nonsense&rdquo; chapter.&nbsp; It is simply
energetic quarter-staff play, with resounding thwacks upon the
head of any unlucky wight who happens to have charged
&ldquo;vulgarity&rdquo; upon Borrow because he had endeavoured to
bring his tatterdemalion crew of gypsies, mumpers, and tinkers
into the decent and respectable parlours of the English
middle-classes.&nbsp; That was all very well on the operatic
stage.&nbsp; The gypsy villains in <i>The Bohemian Girl</i> were
entertaining enough when they entered the marble halls and spoilt
the furniture and pilfered the wine behind the footlights, as
they had been doing any night for the last ten years; but this
was serious literature and a very different matter.&nbsp; Borrow
laid about him with a will, and defended <a
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>smithery
against jobbery, and tinkering against philandering, and the
dingle against the drawing-room with almost lyrical
eloquence.&nbsp; Was it not better for Lavengro to make the forge
glow by the roadside, and manufacture donkey-shoes for Isopel,
than to borrow another man&rsquo;s money and go to Brighton, with
the sister of Annette le Noir, though that would have been an
exceedingly genteel thing to do?&nbsp; Was not the successor of
Jack Slingsby more worthy of respect than Mr. Flamson, the
railway contractor?&nbsp; Had not the jockey at Horncastle, who
offered him a fair price for his horse, a better title to honour
&ldquo;than the scoundrelly lord who attempts to cheat him of
one-fourth of its value?&rdquo;&nbsp; There is great temptation
to quote largely from these hectic chapters, but one sample must
suffice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Millions,&rdquo; he says, seem to think
otherwise on these questions,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;by their servile adoration of people whom,
without rank, wealth, and fine clothes, they would consider
infamous, but whom, possessed of rank, wealth, and glittering
habiliments, they seem to admire all the more for their
profligacy and crimes.&nbsp; Does not a blood-spot or a lust-spot
on the clothes of a blooming emperor give a kind of zest to the
genteel young god?&nbsp; Do not the pride, superciliousness, and
selfishness of a certain aristocracy make it all the more
regarded by its worshippers? and do not the clownish and
gutter-blood admirers of Mr. Flamson like him all the more
because they are conscious that he is a knave?&nbsp; If such is
the case&mdash;and, alas! is it not the case?&mdash;they cannot
be too frequently told that fine clothes, wealth, and titles
adorn a person in proportion as he adorns them; that if worn by
the magnanimous and good they are ornaments indeed, but if by the
vile and profligate they are merely <i>san benitos</i>, and only
serve to <a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>make their infamy doubly apparent; and that a person in
seedy raiment and tattered hat, possessed of courage, kindness,
and virtue, is entitled to more respect from those to whom his
virtues are manifested than any cruel profligate emperor, selfish
aristocrat, or knavish millionaire in the world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The appropriate sequel to this flaming fury against the
worship of material wealth and the idolatry of worldly success is
his protest against Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s Jacobitism, which he
called &ldquo;Scotch gentility-nonsense&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Charlie-o&rsquo;er-the-Waterism.&rdquo;&nbsp; With a full
brush and rapid strokes he paints a Hogarthian picture of the
Stewarts, more remarkable for the piquancy of its epithets than
the accuracy of its history.&nbsp; A disgraceful procession of
abandoned reprobates hurries across his pages: the &ldquo;dirty,
cowardly miscreant,&rdquo; James I.; the &ldquo;cruel, revengeful
tyrant,&rdquo; Charles I.; the &ldquo;lazy and sensual&rdquo;
Charles II.; the &ldquo;poor creature,&rdquo; James II.; and the
miserable Pretenders, especially Charles Edward of that ilk, a
&ldquo;worthless, ignorant youth&rdquo; and a &ldquo;profligate,
illiterate old man.&rdquo;&nbsp; All these lamentable persons,
these blotches on the face of history, according to Borrow, were
dead and happily buried out of the sight of decent people until
Scott gave them resurrection by his power of fine writing.&nbsp;
It was Scott who summoned Jacobitism and Laudism out of their
graves; the wave of Popery now passing so destructively over
England came from Oxford, it was true; but Scott sent it to
Oxford.&nbsp; And Scott, accordingly, <a name="page317"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 317</span>is scarified.&nbsp; His secret is
ruthlessly wrenched from him.&nbsp; Why did he revive
Jacobitism?&nbsp; It was because he worshipped gentility and
adored the born-great.&nbsp; Scott denounced Murat and heaped
contumely upon him as the son of a pastrycook; but was not the
pedigree of the pastrycook better than that of the Edinburgh
pettifogger who was Scott&rsquo;s progenitor?</p>
<p>Working himself up to a foaming frenzy, Borrow attributes all
Scott&rsquo;s mortal sufferings to the vengeance of an angry
Deity for taking the part of the wicked Jacobites against the
righteous Williamites, &ldquo;for lauding up to the skies the
miscreants and robbers, and calumniating the noble spirts of
Britain, the salt of England, and his own country!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Scott became paralysed in body and mind, pitiable to others, and
loathsome to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaims Borrow,
&ldquo;God knows perfectly well how to strike!&rdquo;&nbsp; A
modern audience gapes in amazement at the rodomontade, and
wonders whether the man who pumps it out page after page can be
quite sane, especially when he declares that he has been
influenced &ldquo;not by any feeling of malice or ill-will, but
simply by a regard for the truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Borrow saw red
whenever he was out raiding the pastures of &ldquo;Popery&rdquo;
or seeking a joust with gentility, and the verdict against him
may be softened a little when the reader lights upon one or more
of his fine tributes to the genius of Scott, who &ldquo;did for
the sceptre of the wretched Pretender what all the kings of
Europe <a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
318</span>could not do for his body&mdash;placed it on the throne
of these realms; and for Popery what Popes and Cardinals strove
in vain to do for three centuries&mdash;brought back its
mummeries and nonsense into the temples of the British
Isles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eighth chapter of the Appendix, &ldquo;On Canting
Nonsense,&rdquo; need not detain us; his outbreak against the
teetotalers and anti-pugilists has received sufficient
notice.&nbsp; As for the &ldquo;Pseudo-Critics,&rdquo; every
Borrow lover wishes it had never been written, picturesque as is
the apologue of the eminent reviewers of the London Press in the
character of vipers with their fangs drawn, held up by their
tails.&nbsp; Still more is it to be regretted that Borrow&rsquo;s
temper in the dispute with Bowring led him to perpetrate the last
two chapters, full of rancour and spleen as they are, their
charges of perfidy against Sir John unsupported by any evidence,
and contradicted by the probabilities of the case.</p>
<p>Borrow was clearly no competent critic of his own work.&nbsp;
He concludes the Appendix with a pronouncement on the merits and
the purpose of &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; which, he says, was
&ldquo;written for the express purpose of inculcating virtue,
love of country, learning, manly pursuits, and genuine
religion&mdash;for example, that of the Church of
England.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not the morals of &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo;
not its &ldquo;patriotism&rdquo; (which is of a peculiar brand),
not its philology, not its theology, give the strange book
life.&nbsp; Its value lies in its poetry, its <a
name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>portraits,
its atmosphere, its self-revelation, its literary power, and,
above all, in that ruling sense of the joy of living which, in
spite of all its errant morbidity, is the inspiration of the
book.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a wind on the heath, brother. .
.&nbsp; Who would wish to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a difficult thing for one who is not a Welshman to
approach such a book as &ldquo;Wild Wales&rdquo; in any useful
temper save humility.&nbsp; To attack the subject in the spirit
which animated Borrow when he invaded the country would be to
court disaster, and the disgrace inevitably attending such an
enterprise would be well merited.&nbsp; It is not given to many
to carry a charmed life as Borrow did&mdash;going into Wales and
compelling the admiration of those whom his prickly prejudices
and his violent intolerance most offended.</p>
<p>The spell Wales casts over men&rsquo;s minds, and the hold it
has upon men&rsquo;s hearts, are elusive things.&nbsp; Having no
tangible substance, they are yet as real as a battleship.&nbsp;
Many people feel them acutely, but are not content to endure and
enjoy them.&nbsp; There is a desire, in these definitive days, to
analyse, to dissect, to explain them, to label and classify them;
but at the slightest touch of the scalpel, at the vision of the
quill, they vanish.&nbsp; As with Cornwall, so with
Wales&mdash;indeed, in many respects they are one,&mdash;the
charm they wield is a charm of atmosphere, of vague overhanging
mysteries and underdwelling romances.&nbsp; Those who feel it are
under the magic influence of the <a name="page320"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 320</span>Celtic spirit, and it has been well
said that &ldquo;to boast of the Celtic spirit is to confess you
have it not.&rdquo; <a name="citation320"></a><a
href="#footnote320" class="citation">[320]</a></p>
<p>I have endeavoured to show that Borrow, in spite of his pose
of Anglo-Saxonism, was a true Celt, a very wisp of the Celtic
spirit itself.&nbsp; The fact explains everything about his tour
in Wales, his intercourse with Welshmen, and his success in
achieving a book which they are quite willing to confess is one
of the best books ever written about their country.&nbsp; The
spell was upon him, and he was content to let it work without
attempting to divide it, chemically or mechanically, into its
component elements.&nbsp; It worked through the scenery which he
described with his peculiar skill, whether of massive mountain
and lonely lake, or of sweet vale and tinkling cascade.&nbsp; It
worked through the language, which he admired for its wonderful
soft music concealed under apparently fortuitous concourses of
crabbed consonants.&nbsp; It worked through the character of the
people for whom he had so strong an affinity hidden behind all
his affectation of downrightishness, John-Bullish egotism and
pride.&nbsp; He was completely successful in his tribute to
Wales&mdash;one of the finest in English literature.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the most amazing thing in all his amazing
career.&nbsp; For Borrow trampled&mdash;or appeared to
trample&mdash;remorselessly on some of the most delicate feelings
of Welshmen.&nbsp; His hatred of Rome was <a
name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 321</span>hardly
greater than his hatred of nonconformity with the Church of
England.&nbsp; This peeps out of many a page of &ldquo;Wild
Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thousands of Welsh people must be aroused to
a point just short of fury by his satirical or abusive allusions
to Dissenters.&nbsp; But most of them are tempted past the
danger-spot by Borrow&rsquo;s love of Wales and his power to
enchant the reader as he himself was enchanted.</p>
<p>A militant Welshman once said to me that Borrow &ldquo;allowed
his hatred of Nonconformity to colour all his descriptions of the
people.&nbsp; His pictures of Welsh Nonconformists are terribly
exaggerated, and he damaged his book by his want of sympathy with
the then budding aspirations of Wales, which have bloomed into
the present political and ecclesiastical conditions well known to
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; That may very likely be a true view of the work
through Cymric spectacles; yet the same person confessed that he
knew no book of the kind which he liked better than &ldquo;Wild
Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; The reason was that, in spite of his contempt
for the budding aspirations of the Nationalists, Borrow contrived
to do the Welsh nation a high literary service by demonstrating
its individuality, its distinction, its difference from England,
in every line he wrote about it.&nbsp; His border-line is sharp
and clear; passing into Wales, he passes into a more ethereal
air; passing through Wales he is in a land of
enchantment&mdash;not vague and misty, consisting of reminders of
a distant past, but actual and present, <a
name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>where,
<i>pace</i> Mr. Edward Thomas, &ldquo;they talk of hero and poet
as if they had met them on the hills; and, as the poet has said,
&lsquo;Folly would it be to say that Arthur has a
grave.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s Welsh, so far as it can be judged from the
book, is exceedingly good, considering the circumstances in which
it was acquired.&nbsp; His knowledge of &ldquo;the spoken
word&rdquo; was comparatively slight.&nbsp; His intercourse had
been far more intimate with Welsh books than with Welshmen.&nbsp;
Indeed, we do not hear of many colloquies between this Welsh
scholar and Welsh people until he arrives at the age of
fifty.&nbsp; There are only two of any importance mentioned in
his works.&nbsp; First in point of date was the episode of the
Welsh groom whose acquaintance he gained when serving his
articles in Took&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp; Next was that of the Welsh
Methodist preacher, Peter Williams, and his wife, described in
&ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the rest, Ab Gwilym and the
bards were his Welsh mentors.&nbsp; In these conditions, His
knowledge of the language became quite remarkable.&nbsp; It was a
working medium for him in those parts of the Principality where
the phrase &ldquo;Dim Saesneg&rdquo; was most often heard.&nbsp;
Welshmen tell me that a curious feature of &ldquo;Wild
Wales&rdquo; is that the Welsh in the first part of the book is
more correct than that in the second.&nbsp; As one remarks, it
was &ldquo;the romance of the language which captivated
him.&nbsp; He was more familiar with its rugged mountains than
with its <a name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
323</span>tender parts.&nbsp; This it was that inspired his
passionate regard for Ab Gwilym and Elis Wyn above other Welsh
writers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Welsh estimates of the Welsh writers whom Borrow most affected
are not quite the same as his own.&nbsp; It is said that in a
general way his appreciations are just, but that he gives too
high a place to Ab Gwilym, who was by no means the chief of the
Welsh poets read about 1850.&nbsp; Ab Gwilym&rsquo;s language is
cumbrous, and his manner laborious.&nbsp; He had mastered his art
with difficulty, and his work therefore betrays an almost
complete lack of spontaneity.&nbsp; Yet his services to Welsh
poetry were considerable, for he began a new revival of the
bardic art when it had for a long time been under a cloud.&nbsp;
He revelled, if with something of grandiosity, in the majestic in
Nature, and his Ode to the Thunder is certainly
impressive&mdash;the language producing a cumulative effect of
elemental noise which is exceedingly remarkable.&nbsp; It is
hardly surprising that Borrow was attracted to Ab Gwilym, whose
satire and invective in the treatment of his rival, Bwa Bach, are
echoed in much of Borrow&rsquo;s own writing.&nbsp; Elis Wyn was
a horse of a very different colour, and has a reputation in Welsh
literature which even Borrow does not exaggerate.&nbsp; His
mystic imaginings are daring in the extreme, and his style is
vivid; others than Borrow adjudge the <i>Bardd Cwsg</i> to be
equal in many parts to Dante at his highest.</p>
<p><a name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
324</span>&ldquo;The Sleeping Bard; or, Visions of the World,
Death, and Hell; by Elis Wyn, translated from the Cambrian
British by George Borrow, author of,&rdquo; etc., etc., is a rare
book now.&nbsp; The copy before me, in its flimsy salmon-coloured
paper cover, with its uncut edges and all its evidences of
country, job-printing (in spite of John Murray&rsquo;s imprint),
is priced at two guineas.&nbsp; Somehow, its dress seems fitting,
Borrovian.&nbsp; One would rather this informality for the weird
imaginings and the sulphuric vaticinations of the Denbighshire
mystic than any finer guise of print and binding.&nbsp; The gusto
with which Borrow attacked a task of this kind is obvious from
preface to epilogue.&nbsp; He traces the influence, of
Quevedo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Visions or Discourses&rdquo; upon the
matter, and the style of Elis Wyn, especially with reference to
the character of Rhywun, that symbolical &ldquo;Somebody,&rdquo;
who complains in the Vision of Death that so much of the villainy
and scandal in the world is attributed to him: Rhywun&rsquo;s
forerunner is the Juan de la Encina of Quevedo&rsquo;s
work.&nbsp; He considers, however, that the Welshman&rsquo;s work
is superior to that of the Spaniard.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that Elis Wyn was acquainted with
Quevedo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Visions,&rdquo; either in the original or
in the English translation published in London about the
beginning of the eighteenth century.&nbsp; The resemblance
between the Welsh &ldquo;Vision of the World&rdquo; and the
Spanish &ldquo;Interior of the <a name="page325"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 325</span>World Disclosed&rdquo; is too close
for any other verdict, the similarity of Elis Wyn&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Vision of Hell&rdquo; to Quevedo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sties of
Pluto&rdquo; too remarkable.&nbsp; But Borrow seems to have
overlooked or rejected&mdash;at any rate, he does not
mention&mdash;the much greater probability that the composition
of this allegory in Welsh was suggested by &ldquo;The
Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; which was hardly half a century
old when &ldquo;The Sleeping Bard&rdquo; appeared.&nbsp; A deeply
religious minister like Elis Wyn may reasonably be conceived to
have been fired with the desire to do for the Welsh people in the
Welsh vernacular what the inspired tinker had done in English for
the common people of his country.</p>
<p>Judged by Borrow&rsquo;s translation, the literary merits of
&ldquo;The Sleeping Bard&rdquo; come out very high.&nbsp; Whether
they are as splendid as the plentiful comparisons with classical
writers would suggest can only be estimated by those who are
deeply versed in the Welsh literary medium.&nbsp; What more
immediately concerns us is the quality of Borrow&rsquo;s
rendering.&nbsp; His style lent itself admirably to the
interpretation of the ideas in the book, and whatever the
excellences or defects of his work as a translator, the effect he
produces, especially in the most lurid parts of the
&ldquo;Visions,&rdquo; is often superb.&nbsp; There is
magnificent prose in the last section, the &ldquo;Vision of
Hell&rdquo;&mdash;notably in the dialogues between Lucifer and
his hosts.&nbsp; Lucifer&rsquo;s address to the &ldquo;potentates
of Hell! <a name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
326</span>princes of the black abodes of Despair!&rdquo; is a
gigantic conception of the eternal warfare of Good and Evil,
couched in language of extraordinary power.&nbsp; Take the
speech, in which he urges his confederates to greater exertions
against the Omnipotent:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . . although the Almighty Enemy sent his
own son to die for the beings of that world; yet I, by my
baubles, obtain ten souls for every one which he obtains by his
crucified son.&nbsp; And although I have not been able to reach
him who sits in the high places and discharges the invincible
thunder-bolts, yet revenge of some kind is sweet.&nbsp; Let us
complete the destruction of the remnant of human beings still in
the favour of our destroyer.&nbsp; I remember the time when you
caused them to be burnt by multitudes and cities, and even the
whole race of the earth, by means of the flood, to be swept down
to us in the fire.&nbsp; But at present, though your strength and
your natural cruelty are not a whit diminished, yet you are
become in some degree inactive; if that had not been the case we
might long since have destroyed the few who are godly, and have
caused the earth to be united with this our vast empire.&nbsp;
But know, ye black ministers of my displeasure, that unless ye be
more resolute and more diligent, and make the most of the
short-time that remains to you for doing evil, ye shall
experience the weight of my anger, in torments new and strange to
the whole of you.&nbsp; This I swear, by the deepest Hell, and
the vast eternal pit of darkness.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moloch arises to protest against the censure, to declare, how
he has joyed in the sufferings of men, &ldquo;the shrieks of
infants perishing in the fire as of old, when thousands of
sucklings were sacrificed to me outside of
Jerusalem.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lucifer laughs in the face of his
&ldquo;heartless legions,&rdquo; and announces his intention to
go to the Earth in his own kingly person: <a
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>&ldquo;Not
one man, henceforth, shall be found on the earth to adore the
Almighty.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thereupon he gave a furious bound,
attempting to set off in a firmament of living fire; but, behold!
the fist above his head shook the terrific bolt till he trembled
in the midst of his frenzy, and before he could move far an
invisible hand lugged the old fox back by his chain in spite of
his teeth.&nbsp; Whereupon he became seven times more frantic;
his eyes were more terrible than lightnings, black, thick smoke
burst from his nostrils, and dark green flames from his mouth and
entrails; he gnawed his chain in agony, and hissed forth direful
blasphemy and the most frightful curses.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Myn Diawl!&rdquo; as the little bookseller of
Smithfield ejaculated.&nbsp; No wonder he regarded Elis Wyn as a
terrible fellow.&nbsp; While Borrow was engaged in transferring
these scenes into English, contrasting the peaceful figure of the
Bard asleep on the summit of Cader Idris with the appalling
spectacles of his dreams, delighting in the process of heaping
horror upon horror and crashing them against the &ldquo;squeamish
nonsense&rdquo; of his age, he did not fail to be
effective.&nbsp; It was when he took to verse that he failed: the
metrical translations at the end of each section are the weakest
things in the book.&nbsp; Elis Wyn had a salty humour, and used
it well upon &ldquo;the oddities and follies which men
commit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Several of Borrow&rsquo;s own pet aversions
are held up to ridicule&mdash;gentility, coquetry, tobacco, and
so on.&nbsp; With what zest he relates the mockery in Hell of
&ldquo;two honourable gentlemen, newly arrived, who were
insisting on being shown respect suitable to their
gentility&rdquo; <a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
328</span>may be imagined.&nbsp; The condemnation of tobacco is
worthy of slobbering James himself: &ldquo;For what is tobacco
but one of my meanest instruments to carry bewilderment into the
brain?&rdquo; asks Beelzebub.</p>
<p>Borrow made good use of Elis Wyn, not only in this
translation, but in &ldquo;Wild Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; The intensely
humorous conversation with Bos the drover at Pentraeth Coch will
be remembered:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Pray excuse me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but
is not droving rather a low-lifed occupation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not half so much as pig-jobbing,&rdquo; said Bos,
&ldquo;and that that&rsquo;s your trade, I&rsquo;m certain, or
you would never have gone to Llanfair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am no pig-jobber,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and when I
asked you that question about droving, I merely did so because
one Elis Wyn, in a book he wrote, gives the drovers a very bad
character, and puts them in Hell for their
malpractices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he does,&rdquo; said Mr. Bos, &ldquo;well, the next
time I meet him at Corwen I&rsquo;ll crack his head for saying
so.&nbsp; Malpractices&mdash;he had better look at his own, for
he is a pig-jobber, too.&nbsp; Written a book, has he?&nbsp; Then
I suppose he has been left a legacy, and gone to school after
middle-age, for when I last saw him, which is four years ago, he
could neither read nor write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was about to tell Mr. Bos that the Elis Wyn I meant was no
more a pig-jobber than myself, but a respectable clergyman who
had been dead considerably upwards of a hundred years, and that
also, notwithstanding my respect for Mr. Bos&rsquo;s knowledge of
history, I did not believe that Owen Tudor was buried at
Penmynnydd, when I was prevented . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he made equally good use of the other bards and heroes of
Wales, both in his colloquies with comic persons like Mr. Bos or
with the bard of Anglesey, &ldquo;the greatest Prydydd in the
whole world,&rdquo; who kept <a name="page329"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 329</span>an inn at L&mdash;, and believed
&ldquo;the awen or inspiration was quite as much at home in the
bar as in the barn, perhaps more&rdquo;; and in his outbursts of
apostrophic eloquence&mdash;as when he stood on Holyhead:
&ldquo;&lsquo;Some king, giant, or man of old renown lies buried
beneath this cairn,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whoever he may be
I trust he will excuse me for mounting it, seeing that I do so
with no disrespectful spirit.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; A glowing
vision follows of the scenes which had passed beneath that grey
promontory, from the times of the Druids, &ldquo;long-bearded men
with white vestments, toiling up the rocks, followed by fierce
warriors with glittering helms and short, broad, two-edged
swords,&rdquo; as the army of Suetonius pursued them; &ldquo;I
thought I heard groans, cries of rage, and the dull, awful sound
of bodies precipitated down the rocks . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow
may not have sympathised with the modern aspirations of
Nationalist Wales, but he certainly succeeded in demonstrating
its nationality, in understanding its poetry, and in visualising
its romance.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s purely poetical works remain to be
considered.&nbsp; The ballad literature of many lands had
overpowering fascination for him.&nbsp; This was a perfectly
natural affinity.&nbsp; In the ballads, if anywhere, is to be
found the &ldquo;homely, plain writing&rdquo; which Borrow
admired.&nbsp; In them, too, were enshrined the histories of the
characters he loved or the heroes he adored.&nbsp; If the public
had afforded him more encouragement, we should have had a series
of transcripts <a name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
330</span>and translations spreading over many years.&nbsp;
Fortunately, sheer force of circumstances pushed Borrow into
another literary channel and gave us his prose books.&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s lyrical genius is hardly a matter for discussion;
it simply does not exist, in spite of Allan Cunningham&rsquo;s
eulogies.&nbsp; Most of his verse is artificial, stilted, and in
the most violent contrast with the vigorous naturalism of his
prose.&nbsp; He seemed to have a lyrical sense, but no capacity
for recording its impressions.&nbsp; The result is a mass of
doggerel, here and there lightened and vivified by a stanza or
two of real beauty, happening simply where a concourse of chances
gave him subject, imaginative idea, and words which
harmonised.&nbsp; These flashes of inspiration, however, are
rare.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The &ldquo;Romantic Ballads&rdquo; which he translated in his
youth from the old Danish and from &OElig;hlenschlaeger are
exceedingly interesting because of their matter: the legends
include some of the great ones of the Northern world.&nbsp; But
Borrow&rsquo;s verse would provide a deep disappointment for any
reader who, having made acquaintance with his prose through
&ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; for example, had conceived high
expectations of his poetry.&nbsp; The copy which lies before me
is an exceedingly interesting one.&nbsp; I am indebted for its
use to Mr. Francis Edwards, the bookseller in Marylebone; whose
property it is.&nbsp; The volume is in the original coloured
boards as it was issued from the press of S. Wilkin at Norwich in
1826.&nbsp; It was <a name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
332</span>Borrow&rsquo;s own copy.&nbsp; In it he had erased many
lines and stanzas, and written, either in ink or pencil, others
to take their place.&nbsp; There is no record of the date at
which this revision was undertaken&mdash;doubtless with a view to
a second edition which was never called for,&mdash;but the
evidence of the handwriting shows that it was done in his youth,
during the &ldquo;veiled period,&rdquo; and probably before
1830.&nbsp; The finnicking calligraphy&mdash;plain to read, and
full of character, but exceedingly fine and minute&mdash;is his
early style, the style of the letters to Bowring, and not that of
the later period when he rushed through his manuscripts in odd
notebooks and on the backs of old accounts or envelopes.</p>
<p>The book illustrates the fact that at this time the Bowring
influence was strong on him, and that he and Bowring were on
cordial terms.&nbsp; The title-page is adorned by a quatrain of
Bowring&rsquo;s:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Through gloomy paths unknown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Paths which untrodden be,<br />
From rock to rock I roam<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the dashing sea.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The opening pages are occupied by a poetical address to Borrow
from Allan Cunningham, whose encouragement and praise had
prompted him to issue the work.&nbsp; Cunningham apostrophises
him in numbers like these:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sing, sing, my friend!&nbsp; Breathe life
again<br />
Through Norway&rsquo;s song and Denmark&rsquo;s
strain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>A few
examples from among the many manuscript amendments made by
Borrow&mdash;which Mr. Edwards has courteously permitted me to
give&mdash;will let some light into the mental workshop of the
versifier.&nbsp; In the ballad of &ldquo;The Death Raven&rdquo;
Dame Sigrid is lying on the deck of the ship watching the setting
of the sun:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Original</span>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Then all at once the smiling sky drew
dark,<br />
The breaker&rsquo;s raved, and sinking seemed the bark;<br />
The wild Death Raven, perched upon the mast,<br />
Screamed &rsquo;mid the tumult and awoke the blast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The foam-clad billows to repose he brought,<br />
And tamed the tempest with the speed of thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above her head its leaf the aspen shook,<br />
Moist as her cheek and pallid as her look.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Revision</span>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Deformed with breakers then the ocean
grew,<br />
The water spirted in the ship&rsquo;s sides through;<br />
Perched on the mast the wild Death Raven yells,<br />
Whilst deep the vessel downward he impels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The billows clad with foam he tames with ease,<br />
And at his glance the savage tempests cease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above her head its boughs the aspen spread,<br />
Like her it quaked, like her cold sweat it shed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This ballad is a translation from &OElig;hlenschlaeger, and
produces an eerie effect of magic forces acting in the natural
world&mdash;the Death Raven as the spirit of Evil bargaining with
its victim and wreaking hideous woe and bloody tragedy till it is
finally overcome by the vengeance of a pure maiden who calls to
her aid <a name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
334</span>the supernal powers against the infernal.&nbsp; But
Borrow is in literal difficulties all the time, and the story
hitches and tears on the irregularities and ugly angles of his
verse.&nbsp; In the ballad of &ldquo;Aager and Eliza&rdquo; (from
the old Danish collection of Heroic Romances edited by Vegel in
1591), it is hard to choose between the banalities of his two
versions:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Original</span>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Have ye heard of the bold Sir Aager,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How he rode to yonder isle?<br />
There he saw the sweet Eliza<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who upon him deigned to smile.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Revision</span>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas the valiant knight, Sir
Aager,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How he to the island hied.<br />
There he wedded . . . <a name="citation334"></a><a
href="#footnote334" class="citation">[334]</a> Else,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She of maidens was the pride.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best thing in the book is the ballad of &ldquo;Swayne [or
Svend] Vonved,&rdquo; of which we have heard a good deal from
Borrow, Leland, and others.&nbsp; This is also from Vegel&rsquo;s
collection.&nbsp; Borrow quotes as a preface to it Grimm&rsquo;s
account of the legend.&nbsp; Svend Vonved was a terrible fellow,
minstrel and warrior, sent out to avenge the death of his father,
and the poem relates his desperate deeds of valour and blood, his
victories over &ldquo;knights of pride,&rdquo; his short way with
the female magicians, and his last characteristic
action&mdash;the destruction of the harp on which he had twanged
accompaniment to his songs, so that &ldquo;no <a
name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 335</span>sweet sound
shall in future soothe his wild humour.&rdquo;&nbsp; One
manuscript alteration only in this ballad is of interest; it
occurs in the episode of the fight with the Brute Carle:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Original</span>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They fought for a day, they fought for
two,<br />
And so on the third they were fain to do;<br />
But, ere the fourth day reached the night,<br />
The Brute Carle fell, and was slain outright&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look out, look out, Svend
Vonved!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Revision</span>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They fought for a day, they fought for
two,<br />
And so on the third they were fain to do;<br />
But, ere the fourth day the night had reached,<br />
The Brute dead on the earth he stretched&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look out, look out, Svend
Vonved!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a lighter vein there is the ballad of &ldquo;The Deceived
Merman,&rdquo; which had appeared with some of the other poems in
the <i>Monthly Magazine</i> while Borrow was engaged with
Phillips.&nbsp; In the <i>Magazine</i> it began:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fair Agnes left her mother&rsquo;s
door.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first revision occurred prior to the collection of the
ballads in book-form, when it began:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fair Agnes lone on the sea-shore stood,<br
/>
Then rose a Merman from out the flood:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, Agnes, hear what I say to thee&mdash;<br />
Wilt thou my leman consent to be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O, freely that will I become<br />
If thou but take me beneath the foam.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>The
third couplet is altered in the manuscript revision to read
thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, yes, forsooth that will I be<br
/>
If thou&rsquo;lt take me to the bottom of the
sea.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The merman did, and there was a family.&nbsp; But Agnes,
having obtained permission to go back and visit her mother, came
under religious influences, stayed overlong, and was finally deaf
to all the requests of her amphibious spouse that she should
return to her deserted family, proving unmaternal enough even to
disregard an appeal <i>ad misericordiam</i> on behalf of the
youngest of the merbabies. <a name="citation336"></a><a
href="#footnote336" class="citation">[336]</a></p>
<p>The &ldquo;Ballads&rdquo; have some interest, but, with the
exception of &ldquo;Svend Vonved,&rdquo; they have small merit,
and it is not surprising that the public took so little notice of
them that the second edition was never required.&nbsp; Borrow
made much better play with his Danish legends and his heroes of
the North in his later prose books, where they take their proper
place as the material of souffl&eacute;s or as flavouring in a
tasty m&eacute;lange.</p>
<h2><a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
337</span>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CHARACTERISTICS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is but one authentic portrait
of Borrow, it is the painting in the possession of Mr. John
Murray, by whose kind permission it has been reproduced for this
work.&nbsp; An engraving from it was used as the frontispiece to
the first edition of &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; and it has always
been known as &ldquo;the &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo;
portrait.&rdquo;&nbsp; If there is anything in the theory that a
man reaches a certain climacteric when Nature, having done all
she can for him, designs that he shall sit for his portrait,
Borrow seems to have sat at the identical moment.&nbsp; It would
be impossible to wish for a better view of Don Jorge than
this.</p>
<p>The white hair, the swart complexion, the brilliant eyes, the
almost affectedly unconventional dress, give an impression of the
man which irresistibly recalls the romance of his youthful
exploits and the weird poetry of the most poetical part of his
career.&nbsp; It was this striking appearance of his, and his
commanding height, combined with his unorthodox outlook, which
gave him his unquestionable influence with the gypsies.&nbsp; It
helped to make him, during the one blazing season of his social
celebrity, the lion of <a name="page338"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 338</span>the London drawing-rooms.&nbsp; If
he failed to maintain his popularity, it was in spite of his
appearance, which had wonderful distinction.</p>
<p>No Borrovian regrets that Borrow failed, that he did not
remain the pet of society, and that he was only for a brief space
encouraged to Byronic affectations and ambitions.&nbsp; In
following his wayward sprites into all the <i>b&ecirc;tises</i>
he committed, in alienating himself from the fashionable world
and getting himself infinitely disliked by people who were ready
to idolise him if he would have subscribed to all their
conventions, Borrow wrought better than he knew.&nbsp; He would
not have been Borrow, in fact, if, after the publication of
&ldquo;The Bible in Spain,&rdquo; he had submitted to the
influences of the great world and become a manufacturer of
popular books.&nbsp; He would have written a great deal more and
a great deal worse; he would have lost his piquancy to acquire
gentility; he would have become suave, smooth, complacent, and
pious, instead of being rugged, rebellious, boorish&mdash;and
Borrow.</p>
<p>Such speculations are needless.&nbsp; It was impossible for
Borrow to be other than Borrow was.&nbsp; The rudeness of his
manner was no pose: this was an elemental spirit that could not
avoid being itself, whatever veneer it eroded, whatever polish it
dulled.&nbsp; The angularity, the abruptness, the most
fascinating and most irritating qualities of his work&mdash;these
also were no affectation.&nbsp; They arose naturally out of the
<a name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
339</span>qualities of the man himself.&nbsp; There is no writer
who has put more of his ego into his work than Borrow.&nbsp; One
looks at his portrait, contemplates his ancestry and his
training, and admits that if this man were to become a writer
there was no other kind of writer he could have become than the
author of &ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is possible to lay too
much stress on Borrow&rsquo;s boorishness, and this is the very
last place in which it should be done.&nbsp; His strain of
melancholia often verged upon madness: any measured judgment of
his life must take account of that fact, and it will explain much
that is otherwise difficult to understand.&nbsp; I have been
informed that he suffered in his youth from the
&ldquo;touching&rdquo; mania, and that even if on his travels
described in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; he did meet a gentleman who
was thus afflicted, the extraordinary vigour and vividness of the
scenes in which the malady is depicted are due to his own painful
acquaintance with it.&nbsp; Again, I have been told that the
incident in &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; where the old man
studies the Chinese language through the medium of the legends
inscribed on teapots, is drawn from his own experience, and that
he turned to pursuits of this kind in order to stave off the
horrors of melancholy which afflicted him in his moods of
self-concentration.&nbsp; A man of this extraordinary
sensibility, passing his youth at the eye-piece of a
kaleidoscope, so to speak, afflated with poetry in boyhood, in
narrow circumstances, buffeted by ill-fortune <a
name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 340</span>for many
years, chasing many a Will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp, could not help
being &ldquo;a queer chap,&rdquo; as Ford said.&nbsp; He was
soured by circumstance in his early days.&nbsp; In middle life,
when the sunshine of success burst upon him for a time, he became
more genial.&nbsp; The picture of him one gets in his Cornish and
Welsh tours is very pleasant.&nbsp; But he became cold again in
later years, and was a bitter man after the death of his wife had
broken the strongest link between him and his fellows.</p>
<p>His personal and his literary characteristics were, of course,
deeply intermingled.&nbsp; The impatience of pusillanimity which
appears in many a passage of his life was reflected in his
works.&nbsp; He had an overpowering admiration of courage and
strength, either mental or physical.&nbsp; There is a sentence or
two in &ldquo;The Bible in Spain,&rdquo; describing the last day
of Quesada, which gives light upon Borrow&rsquo;s idols:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No action of any conqueror or hero on
record is to be compared with this closing scene in the life of
Quesada, for who, by his single desperate courage and
impetuosity, ever stopped a revolution in full course?&nbsp;
Quesada did; he stopped the revolution at Madrid for one entire
day, and brought back the uproarious and hostile mob of a huge
city to perfect order and quiet.&nbsp; His burst into the Puerta
del Sol was the most tremendous and successful piece of daring
ever witnessed.&nbsp; I admired so much the spirit of the brute
bull that I frequently during his wild onset shouted &lsquo;Vive
Quesada!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the same note of admiration is struck with reference to
many a pugilist and criminal in whose career it is difficult to
find anything to approve.</p>
<p><a name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
341</span>Herein is to be found the secret of much of the power
of what I have called Borrow&rsquo;s naturalism.&nbsp; The
characters he depicts are all intensely alive, and act without
reference to any theory of action.&nbsp; When he was compiling
the &ldquo;Celebrated Trials&rdquo; he had an education in
naturalism which merely developed his own tendencies.&nbsp; When
he introduced into &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; David Haggart, the
friend of his youth at Edinburgh, it was as a real person, and
not as a biographical lay-figure upon which to hang moral
speculations.&nbsp; Not one writer in a hundred would have
treated the Haggart incident as Borrow did, for, courageous as he
was, David was an ingrained rascal, whose villainies would
probably have continued for another half-century if the hangman
had not got hold of him.&nbsp; Borrow did not speculate on
criminology, as the fashion is, and discuss the extent to which
environment was responsible for the career of his
blackguards.&nbsp; He just accepted them in their environment,
and, with glowing admiration for their bravery&mdash;Haggart was
brave enough to run mortal risks for the crimes of his
associates&mdash;transferred them to his pages in their habit as
they lived.&nbsp; Professor Chandler, an American critic, has
accomplished a luminous comparison when he says that
Borrow&rsquo;s realism is of a different quality from
Thackeray&rsquo;s&mdash;the former sympathetic and the latter
satiric.&nbsp; A hundred instances of the truth of this
observation will occur to those who review the <a
name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 342</span>regiments
of rascals which march through the pages of the two authors.</p>
<p>It was the same influence which made Borrow&rsquo;s gypsies so
real that, in spite of all the errors into which imperfect
knowledge of the subject led him, his pictures of the Romany race
remain unapproached for truth of line and naturalness of
colour.&nbsp; Ainsworth drew gypsies; they were stage figures;
they are forgotten.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s gypsies are
immortal.&nbsp; Other authors of his own time visualised
rascality in many forms; Dickens especially created a marvellous
gallery of rogues.&nbsp; But Dickens set up his villains either
in order to punish them in the interests of altruism or to reform
them in the interests of propaganda.&nbsp; Borrow regarded them
from a widely different point of view.&nbsp; They were studies in
real life, and not material for the administration of poetic
justice.&nbsp; It is interesting to contrast his view of a very
popular book with that of a contemporary writer.&nbsp; Charles
Reade was an unequivocal admirer of &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s
Cabin,&rdquo; which he said was &ldquo;great by theme and great
by skill.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have seen what Borrow said about a lot
of &ldquo;Uncle Toms and Uncle Tom-fools.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
idle, perhaps, but not without charm, to guess what he would have
made of a character like Legree if he had been able to persuade
Isopel Berners to take him with her to America and had met with a
slave-driver in that continent.&nbsp; Parallel with this worship
of strength and courage may be placed his taste in <a
name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
343</span>literature.&nbsp; He had little sense of the verbal
niceties of style; his affection was reserved for the robust and
vigorous writing of authors like Defoe, and for the hefty,
rousing force of the narratives which he discovered among the
biographies and autobiographies of criminals in many an aged
pamphlet and forgotten broadsheet.&nbsp; It would, however, be
easy to exaggerate this side of Borrow&rsquo;s character.&nbsp;
He was not merely a non-moral literary berserker.&nbsp; There was
a softer, a more imaginative side to his nature&mdash;not
irreconcilable with the other, because it arose out of the same
quality of sympathy and the same acuteness of vision.&nbsp; This
was manifested most strongly, perhaps, in his later and more
settled years, and perhaps more plainly in his relations with
children than in any others.</p>
<p>Apart from those episodes of his life which form the staple of
his books, the most pleasant picture of the man is to be found in
his days of comparative leisure in East Anglia, when he divided
his time between study, literary work, visits to friends, the
entertainment of friends, and rambles about rural Norfolk and
Suffolk.&nbsp; It was a red-letter day when a gypsy tribe arrived
in the neighbourhood of Oulton.&nbsp; His Romany friends would be
invited to camp in his grounds, to receive him and his people by
their camp-fires, to rokker (talk) Romany with him, and to listen
to his gypsy songs.&nbsp; When there were no gypsies, he would
make explorations into the character and the dialect of the
Norfolk or Suffolk natives, picking <a name="page344"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 344</span>up any chance companion of the
road.&nbsp; He generally succeeded in eliciting a life history
and in pursuing, as far as the duration of the companionship
would allow, a psychological study.&nbsp; Some of his
philological adventures on the country roads have been amusingly
related by Miss Harvey:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When they used some word peculiar to
Norfolk (or Suffolk) countrymen, he would say, &lsquo;Why,
that&rsquo;s a Danish word.&rsquo;&nbsp; By and by the man would
use another peculiar expression: &lsquo;Why, that&rsquo;s
Saxon!&rsquo;&nbsp; A little later, another: &lsquo;Why,
that&rsquo;s French! . . .&nbsp; What a wonderful man you are to
speak so many languages!&rsquo;&nbsp; One man got very angry, but
Mr. Borrow was quite unconscious that he had given any
offence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His taste revolted against the use of foreign words or phrases
in common conversation, though he resorted to the practice very
largely in his books and correspondence.&nbsp; He would chaff his
wife or Miss Clarke if either of them introduced a French word
into talk around the table, crying, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
that?&nbsp; Trying to come over me with strange
languages!&rdquo;&nbsp; The picture of his life at this time,
apart from the petty distractions of his disputes with neighbours
and the controversies with his publisher, is that of a quiet and
pleasant domesticity, occasionally disturbed by fits of
&ldquo;the Horrors.&rdquo;&nbsp; When, nervously depressed into
the depths of gloom, he was unable to sleep, he would get up in
the night and set off on long walks, often stretching them over
the twenty-five miles of road to Norwich.&nbsp; He would return
the next night <a name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
345</span>invigorated by the exercise, and freed from his
enemy.&nbsp; While in good health his existence at the Cottage
was that of a quiet, studious man, spending his evenings with his
wife and her daughter, reading voraciously, entertaining his
acquaintances, and behaving in a tamely rational manner till his
passion was roused or his prejudices were assailed.&nbsp; His
personal habits were quite temperate.&nbsp; He ate little
breakfast, a hearty dinner, and subsequently took only a glass of
cold water before going to bed.</p>
<p>He did not drink nearly so much ale as his panegyrics of malt
liquor might lead the unwary to suppose.&nbsp; Miss Harvey spoke
to him of a lady who had a fondness for a certain
gentleman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Borrow, &ldquo;did he
make her an offer?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Miss
Harvey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;if she had
given him some good ale he would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He appears never to have concerned himself about the character
of the food he ate so long as he had substantial fare.&nbsp; He
amazed the landlady of a Cromer hotel by replying to her inquiry
what he would have for dinner, &ldquo;Give me a piece of
flesh!&rdquo;&nbsp; The landlady mentioned the strange request to
a lady staying in the hotel, and described the person who made
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s Mr.
Borrow.&nbsp; What he wants is a good rump steak.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And a rump steak, being served, quite satisfied him, for it was
his favourite dish.&nbsp; He was exceedingly susceptible to
music&mdash;we have seen his comparison of Mrs. <a
name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>Berkeley&rsquo;s piano to David&rsquo;s harp&mdash;but
he does not appear to have possessed a highly cultured ear, for
Miss Harvey tells us that &ldquo;one piece he seemed never to
tire of hearing.&nbsp; It was a polka, &lsquo;The Redowa,&rsquo;
I think, and when I had finished he used to say, &lsquo;Play that
again, H&mdash;.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard Ford summarises Borrow&rsquo;s character in three
sentences: &ldquo;Borrow is a queer chap. . . .&nbsp; I believe
Borrow to be honest, albeit a gitano.&nbsp; His biography will be
passing strange if he tells the <i>whole</i> truth.&rdquo; <a
name="citation347"></a><a href="#footnote347"
class="citation">[347]</a>&nbsp; There is one strange error in
this.&nbsp; Borrow was not a gypsy, of course, though the vagrant
spirit was lively in him.&nbsp; But he was honest, even when most
mistaken.&nbsp; The most deplorable thing in his career was his
unfounded and grotesque libels upon Bowring, about which it can
only be suggested that he was beside himself with rage and
disappointment when he wrote them, having failed to obtain the
mission from the Government which was the <i>ignis fatuus</i> of
his life.&nbsp; There can be as little question that Borrow
believed himself to have been ill-treated by Bowring as there is
that Bowring was innocent of his charges.&nbsp; The subtle hint
in Ford&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;if he tells the <i>whole</i>
truth,&rdquo; will be appreciated.&nbsp; Borrow did not reveal
everything in his books.&nbsp; It is unreasonable to expect any
man to do so; but in Borrow&rsquo;s case, ellipsis was often used
where statement would have been preferable and more
straight-forward.&nbsp; <a name="page347"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 347</span>Yet the criticism must fall when we
cease to regard his works as purely personal documents and
consider them as works of art.&nbsp; In this respect, addition
would not improve them.&nbsp; Elimination might be tolerated in
the interests of some of the victims of his wrath; but the
destruction of the Appendix, for example, would deprive us of
some of the most powerful vituperative writing in English
literature.&nbsp; The debt that literature owes to Borrow is
great, for he sustained into the nineteenth century the
traditions of the great narrative writers, and his successor is
still to seek.</p>

is no reason for discrediting Mr. Petulengro&rsquo;s affection
for it, but it should be pointed out that gypsies in general,
like all tent-dwellers, regard it as their principal enemy among
the elemental forces.</p>

De Quincey&rsquo;s essay &ldquo;On Murder as One of the Fine
Arts,&rdquo; in which he guided the studies of his readers
&ldquo;from Cain to Mr. Thurtell.&rdquo;&nbsp; De Quincey
whimsically declared that Thurtell&rsquo;s was an inferior
performance; its style was &ldquo;as harsh as Albert D&uuml;rer
and as coarse as Fuseli.&rdquo;&nbsp; The case created as great a
sensation as any murder trial of the nineteenth century.&nbsp;
The circumstances were peculiarly gruesome, for it was affirmed
that Thurtell and his accomplices, after throwing the body into a
pond, went away and sat down to a supper of roast pork; but
afterwards, fearing that the body might be discovered where they
had placed it, took it up and dropped it in another pond.&nbsp;
Thurtell&rsquo;s arrest was a great surprise; his neighbours
accounted him a gentleman.&nbsp; This led to the celebrated
definition, given at the trial by one of the witnesses, who was
asked, &ldquo;What do you mean by a gentleman?&rdquo; and
answered, &ldquo;Well, a person who drives a gig.&rdquo;</p>

Quesada.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Pray
excuse my troubling you with a line.&nbsp; I wish you would send
me as many of the papers and manuscripts, which I left at yours
some twelve years ago, as you can find.&nbsp; Amongst others,
there is an essay on Welsh Poetry, a translation of the Death of
Balder, etc.&nbsp; If I am spared to the beginning of next year I
intend to bring out a volume called &lsquo;Songs of
Denmark,&rsquo; consisting of some selections from the K. Viser,
and specimens from Evald, Gruntvig, Oehlenschl&auml;ger,
etc.&nbsp; I suppose that I must give a few notices of those
people.&nbsp; Have you any history of Danish literature from
which I could glean a few hints?&nbsp; I think you have a book in
two volumes containing specimens of Danish poetry.&nbsp; It would
be useful to me, as I want to translate Ingemann&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Dannebrog,&rsquo; and one or two other pieces.&nbsp; I
shall preface all with an essay on the Danish language.&nbsp; It
is possible that a book of this description may take, as Denmark
is quite an untrodden field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you lend me for a short time a Polish and French
or Polish and German dictionary?&nbsp; I am going carefully
through Mukiewitz, about whom I intend to write an
<i>article</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Bible in Spain&rsquo; is in the Press, and,
with God&rsquo;s permission, will appear about November, in three
volumes.&nbsp; I shall tell Murray to send a copy to my oldest, I
may say my <i>only</i>, friend.&nbsp; Pray let me know how you
are getting on.&nbsp; I every now and then see your name in the
<i>Examiner</i>, the only paper I read.&nbsp; Should you send the

class="footnote">[91]</a>&nbsp; Borrow contemplated carrying out
a plan of his own for the teaching of the Gospel.&nbsp; On
December 27th, 1835, he wrote from Evora in the Alemtejo to Dr.
Bowring as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For the last six weeks I have been
wandering amongst the wilds of the Alemtejo, and have introduced
myself to its rustics, banditti, etc., and become very popular
amongst them; but as it is much more easy to introduce oneself to
the cottage than the hall (though I am not utterly unknown in the
latter) I want you to give or procure me letters to the most
liberal and influential minds of Portugal.&nbsp; I likewise want
a letter from the Foreign Office to Lord de Walden.&nbsp; In a
word, I want to make what interest I can towards obtaining the
admission of the Gospel of Jesus into the public schools of
Portugal which are about to be established.&nbsp; I beg leave to
state that this is <i>my plan</i> and no other person&rsquo;s, as
I was merely sent over to Portugal to observe the disposition of
the people, therefore I do not wish to be named as an Agent of
the B. S., but as a person who has plans for the mental
improvement of the Portuguese; should I receive <i>these
letters</i> within the space of six weeks it will be time enough,
for before setting up my machine in Portugal I wish to lay the
foundation of something similar in Spain.&rdquo;</p>

October 1st, 1892.&nbsp; Miss Harvey and her sister Susan were
two of the closest friends of the Borrows.&nbsp; Their father had
been articled to the law at the same time as Borrow, and had
similar tastes in sport, and their association was long and
genial.&nbsp; The intercourse between these two families led to
an important acquaintanceship for Borrow, that of Gordon
Hake.&nbsp; <i>See</i> p. <span class="indexpageno"><a

<p><a name="footnote112"></a><a href="#citation112"
class="footnote">[112]</a>&nbsp; Richard Ford was almost as
interesting a person as Borrow himself, though a much more
amenable.&nbsp; The discoverer of Velazquez was, at the time of
their acquaintance, living in Heavitree mainly because his
brother James had a prebendal stall in Exeter Cathedral.&nbsp;
There he had built himself a house, in which he had expressed his
own taste in architecture and decoration.&nbsp; His long series
of articles in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> began with an
architectural subject, the &ldquo;cob-walls&rdquo; of
Devonshire&mdash;a mixture of &ldquo;mud&rdquo; and straw, said
to be the warmest, and among the most durable of all walls.&nbsp;
Many examples of this form of building remain in the
neighbourhood of Exeter.&nbsp; Ford traced a connection between
the mud walls of Devon and the concrete used by the Moors and
Ph&oelig;nicians.&nbsp; Ford visited Borrow, at Oulton, in
1844.&nbsp; He was thrice married, the last time in 1851, to
Mary, only daughter of Sir A. Molesworth, the head of the
distinguished Cornish family of that name.&nbsp; Mrs. Ford still
survives, and the author has the privilege of acknowledging her
kindly interest and valuable assistance in his inquiries into the
relations between Borrow and her husband.</p>
<p><a name="footnote118"></a><a href="#citation118"
class="footnote">[118]</a>&nbsp; This was no case of like to
like.&nbsp; Borrow had no great admiration for Le Sage, and
supported the absurd theory that &ldquo;Gil Blas&rdquo; was
&ldquo;a piratical compilation from the works of old Spanish
novelists.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="footnote146"></a><a href="#citation146"
class="footnote">[146]</a>&nbsp; Miss Harvey related (in the
<i>Eastern Daily Press</i>) a story of Borrow&rsquo;s prowess as
a swimmer and diver.&nbsp; He was bathing with a friend, and
after he had plunged under water, nothing was seen of him for so
long a time that his companion began to be alarmed.&nbsp;
Presently, Borrow&rsquo;s voice was heard from afar off, crying:
&ldquo;There!&nbsp; If that had been written in one of my books,
they would have said it was a lie, wouldn&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote154"></a><a href="#citation154"
class="footnote">[154]</a>&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s admiration of
Irish women was comprehensive.&nbsp; He notes that on one of his
visits to the vicarage, Berkeley&rsquo;s aunt was present:
&ldquo;Fine old Irish lady; received me in most kind and
hospitable manner.&rdquo;&nbsp; Later, when Berkeley spent an
evening at Penquite, they discussed and compared Irish and
Cornish women with many illustrations of points of resemblance in
vivacity and difference in character.</p>

Henry Goodman, ninety years old, who in his boyhood had heard the
Cornish language spoken.&nbsp; If this was true, the old tongue
must have lingered in these hills after the death of Dolly

spoke it.&nbsp; And, with regard to the dialect then current, he

class="footnote">[176]</a>&nbsp; Miss Every&rsquo;s companion on
this visit was a Miss Hambly&mdash;name of ill omen!&nbsp; Mr.
William Pollard gave me an amusing addition to Borrow&rsquo;s
observations.&nbsp; &ldquo;At the beginning of last
century,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;things were very different from
what they are now.&nbsp; We had no police or anything of the
kind, except parish constables.&nbsp; Miss Hambly was a
descendant of Edmund Hambly, the parish constable of Menheniot,
whom George Borrow&rsquo;s father fought at Menheniot Fair.&nbsp;
He detested the name, and was as near being rude to Miss Hambly
as he could be.&nbsp; He neglected her all the evening, while
Miss Every was in great feather with him.&nbsp; This is her
book.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was an old edition of &ldquo;The Gypsies of
Spain,&rdquo; in Murray&rsquo;s Home and Colonial Library, with
the signature &ldquo;M. Every&rdquo; in a fine-pointed
handwriting and faded ink; the book had been kept with care; here
and there it was interleaved with neat little cuttings of
sentimental verses, slit from casual newspapers.&nbsp; It should
have lain beside a Victorian jar of rose-leaves.</p>
<p><a name="footnote179"></a><a href="#citation179"
class="footnote">[179]</a>&nbsp; This was the locally celebrated
Pillar at Boconnoc, on &ldquo;Druid&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo;&nbsp; It

present position by modern piety.</p>

<p><a name="footnote187"></a><a href="#citation187"

Introduction to &ldquo;Peveril of the Peak.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Resentment against the alleged injustice of this execution
lingered long in some Celtic districts, even those which were
most Royalist in tendency.&nbsp; This was the case, at any rate,
wherever there were descendants of Christian.&nbsp; So far from
the island as Penzance and so far from the date of the event as
the &rsquo;eighties reference was made to it in tones of
indignation at the gathering of a learned society.&nbsp; There
was a lineal descendant of Brown William, residing in the
town.</p>

favourite hostelries.&nbsp; Another was the Bald-faced Hind, on
the hill above Fairlop the &ldquo;trysting-place&rdquo; of the
gypsies: &ldquo;There they musters from all parts of England, and
there they whoops, dances, and plays; keeping some order
nevertheless because the Rye of all the Romans is in the house,
seated behind the door&rdquo; (&ldquo;Romano Lavo-Lil,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Kirk Yetholm&rdquo;).</p>
<p><a name="footnote249"></a><a href="#citation249"
class="footnote">[249]</a>&nbsp; It would have been about the
same period that, Borrow being at Dr. Gordon Hake&rsquo;s house
at Coombe End, an encampment of gypsies was formed near by on
Wimbledon Common.&nbsp; According to Mr. Mackay, Borrow got Hake
to give the gypsies permission to take water from his well.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They came and helped themselves to the water, and to
everything else to which they became attracted.&nbsp; Hake
represented the circumstances to Borrow.&nbsp; Borrow eloquently
resented the aspersions cast on his friends, and left Coombe End
in high dudgeon&mdash;to return, however, at a subsequent
date.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Egipt speche&rdquo; as Romany.</p>
<p><a name="footnote268"></a><a href="#citation268"
class="footnote">[268]</a>&nbsp; There was a curious reference in
the debate on the Second Reading of the Children&rsquo;s Bill
(House of Commons, March 24th, 1908) to Borrow and his
gypsies.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas Shaw, the Lord Advocate, was describing
the measures proposed by the Bill for dealing with tramp or
wandering children, and &ldquo;reminded the House that the most
beautiful parts of the United Kingdom were often infested by such
children, going about under the charge, not of any regular type
of gypsy, but of mere wandering vagabonds.&nbsp; These children
went from parish to parish, and no local authority got hold of
them.&nbsp; What the Bill did was to say that, if they had no
settled home, or if they were with a guardian who was unfit to
take care of them, they should be subject to seizure.&nbsp; Not
begging alone, but the mere fact of living in a wandering state
and not receiving the education which they would otherwise
receive, would bring them within the range of the provisions of
the Bill.&nbsp; They could be taken before the magistrates and
committed to an industrial school.&nbsp; George Borrow never did
a worse service to his country than by writing
&lsquo;Lavengro,&rsquo; in which he praised this tramping and
wandering life till even the most well-disposed citizens came to
think that there might be something beautiful in it.&nbsp; The
life of children brought up in this way was a life of squalor,
and sometimes of very little else but immorality, and it was high
time the State saw that they were rescued from it&rdquo; (<i>The
Times</i>, March 25th).&nbsp; One does not propose to criticise
the provisions of the Children&rsquo;s Bill, but it is strange
that a Minister should quote &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; in this
way.&nbsp; Borrow was always insisting upon the very facts that
Mr. Shaw cites about the squalor and misery of the mumpers,
&ldquo;pikers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Abrahamites,&rdquo; and the other
vagrom denizens of the roads, and his praise was reserved (in so
far as it was praise at all) for the life of the &ldquo;regular
type of gypsy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="footnote280"></a><a href="#citation280"

&ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo; is still referred to as an authority on
Spanish gypsydom.&nbsp; Pott used it in his great work.&nbsp; Mr.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
